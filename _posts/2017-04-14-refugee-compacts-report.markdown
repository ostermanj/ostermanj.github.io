[Refugee Compacts: Addressing the Crisis of Protracted Displacement](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/refugee-compacts-addressing-the-crisis-of-protracted-displacement) is a digital-first brief summarizing the recommendations of a joint Center for Global Developmentâ€“International Rescue Committee working group.

The working group, recognizing that forced displacement is a long-term problem no longer adequately ameliorated by short-term emergency responses, offers a ten-point roadmap to bridge humanitarian response and long-term development efforts.

This brief is built on the same AngularJS platform as an earlier project, the [More Than a Lightbulb report](/project/2016/04/12/single-page-app-digital-first-publication/). I describe the platform more fully in the earlier post. In short, it has pros and cons, as all platforms do, but ultimately delivers a fast-loading interactive product.
