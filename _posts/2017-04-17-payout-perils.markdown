[Payout for Perils: How Insurance Can Radically Improve Emergency Aid](https://www.cgdev.org/app/reader/3125196?page=0) is the final report of the Center for Global Development's Payouts for Perils Working Group. The report details how agencies and countries vulnerable to natural disasters “can use insurance and index-linked securities to save lives, money, and time by financing emergency response much more effectively and creating healthy incentives to invest in disaster risk reduction.”

One main insight is that while we cannot predict when and where specific disasters may strike, we do know the likelihood that a disaster requiring an international response will strike somewhere. With that risk knowable, it is something that could be insured against, as are other risks. That would mean knowing before disaster strikes that a pool of money would be available for response and having a plan for how it could be used. That could drastically improve the current system of chaotic, ad hoc emergency responses to disasters.

*Payout for Perils* is a pretty long report, weighing in at 30,000 words. That's 15 sections as a digital-first report that generates a pdf, for those who want to print it, that's over 100 pages long. It has 14 interactive graphs, which I built on the Highcharts.js framework (one example is pictured below). Check it all out [here](https://www.cgdev.org/app/reader/3125196?page=0). I give a more in-depth description of the Angular platform in a [previous post](/project/2016/04/12/single-page-app-digital-first-publication/).
