This was the first digital brief for the Commitment to Development Index that was more than just a PDF of the print version. A carousel of cards for each country in the index features a rethought visualization for the data.

The publication is essentially a hand-coded HTML document with custom CSS and JavaScript to handle the interactivity. I'm proud of the design and how it all works, but don't look too closely at the code! :). It's a very early sample.
