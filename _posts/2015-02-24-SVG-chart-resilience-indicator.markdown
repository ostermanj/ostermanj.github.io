This data visualization illustrates an analysis by [Liliana Rojas-Suarez](http://www.cgdev.org/expert/liliana-rojas-suarez) about how well emerging-market countries were prepared for another financial shock in 2014, compared to how well prepared they were in 2007, before the financial crisis of 2008. Rojas-Suarez's data was originally in tables only or in default Excel output. This project reinterprets the original research output into a web-friendly and (minimally) interactive form, with an emphasis on the movement countries made over the seven years, whether for better or for worse.

*The Economist* picked up on the data and reproduced it in March 2015, but in a [less successful reinterpretation](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/03/emerging-markets).

I wrote the tool as plain-vanilla JavaScript writing HTML and SVG to the document. No plugins or libraries.
