[*Results Not Receipts*](https://www.brookings.edu/book/results-not-receipts/) is a forthcoming book of the Center for Global Development by [Charles Kenny](https://www.amazon.com/Charles-Kenny/e/B001JS0O76/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1). Kenny investigates the effects of corruption in foreign assistance and provides recommendations for minimizing them.

The upshot: stricter oversight of how money is spent won't be nearly as effective as paying for pre-agreed results. A greater concern on outcomes would ensure that money is well spent (disbursed only for successful programs) and nudge program implementers to avoid waste, in the form of corruption or otherwise.

I performed a medium-heavy preproduction copy edit on the manuscript that attended to all the mechanical things like cross references and citations, but also pointed out improvements to be made before submitting the manuscript for final production. Those included rearranging chapters and streamlining the arguments within them.

The book is set to be published in the summer of 2017.
