California,2007,Cal. PUC Code 5810,Legislative Intent,,The Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006,"(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (1) Increasing competition for video and broadband services is a matter of statewide concern for all of the following reasons: (A) Video and cable services provide numerous benefits to all Californians including access to a variety of news, public information, education, and entertainment programming. (B) Increased competition in the cable and video service sector provides consumers with more choice, lowers prices, speeds the deployment of new communication and broadband technologies, creates jobs, and benefits the California economy.(C) To promote competition, the state should establish a state-issued franchise authorization process that allows market participants to use their networks and systems to provide video, voice, and broadband services to all residents of the state. (D) Competition for video service should increase opportunities for programming that appeals to California’s diverse population and many cultural communities. (2) Legislation to develop this new process should adhere to the following principles:(A) Create a fair and level playing field for all market competitors that does not disadvantage or advantage one service provider or technology over another. (B) Promote the widespread access to the most technologically advanced cable and video services to all California communities in a nondiscriminatory manner regardless of socioeconomic status.(C) Protect local government revenues and control of public rights-of-way. (D) Require market participants to comply with all applicable consumer protection laws. (E) Complement efforts to increase investment in broadband infrastructure and close the digital divide. (F) Continue access to and maintenance of the public, education, and government (PEG) channels. (G) Maintain all existing authority of the California Public Utilities Commission as established in state and federal statutes. (3) The public interest is best served when sufficient funds are appropriated to the commission to provide adequate staff and resources to appropriately and timely process applications of video service providers and to ensure full compliance with the requirements of this division. It is the intent of the Legislature that, although video service providers are not public utilities or common carriers, the commission shall collect any fees authorized by this division in the same manner and under the same terms as it collects fees from common carriers, electrical corporations, gas corporations, telephone corporations, telegraph corporations, water corporations, and every other public utility providing service directly to customers or subscribers subject to its jurisdiction such that it does not discriminate against video service providers or their subscribers. (4) Providing an incumbent cable operator the option to secure a state-issued franchise through the preemption of an existing cable franchise between a cable operator and any political subdivision of the state, including, but not limited to, a charter city, county, or city and county, is an essential element of the new regulatory framework established by this act as a matter of statewide concern to best ensure equal protection and parity among providers and technologies, as well as to achieve the goals stated by the Legislature in enacting this act. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that a video service provider shall pay as rent a franchise fee to the local entity in whose jurisdiction service is being provided for the continued use of streets, public facilities, and other rights-of-way of the local entity in order to provide service. The Legislature recognizes that local entities should be compensated for the use of the public rights-of-way and that the franchise fee is intended to compensate them in the form of rent or a toll, similar to that which the court found to be appropriate in Santa Barbara County Taxpayers Association v. Board of Supervisors for the County of Santa Barbara (1989) 209 Cal. App. 3d 940.(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that collective bargaining agreements be respected. (d) It is the intent of the Legislature that the definition of gross revenues in this division shall result in local entities maintaining their existing level of revenue from franchise fees.","Addresses legislative intent for increasing competition for video and broadband services in order to increase customer choice, reduce prices, hasten deployment of new technologies, improve the variety of programming, and benefit the economy of the state through a state-issued franchise authorization process.

Only through free, open, and transparent competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be ensured. The preservation and expansion of that competition are basic to the economic well-being of this state and that well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises is encouraged and developed. Therefore, it is the declared policy of the state to aid the interests of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises in order to preserve reasonable and just prices and a free competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for commodities, supplies, technology, property, and services for regulated public utilities, including, but not limited to, renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects, are awarded to women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the state. (b) (1) The Legislature finds all of the following: (A) The opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises is essential if this state is to attain social and economic equality for those businesses and improve the functioning of the state economy.

(C) Women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises have traditionally received less than a proportionate share of regulated public utility procurement contracts, especially in renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects. (D) It is in the state’s interest to expeditiously improve the economically disadvantaged position of women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. (E) The position of these businesses can be substantially improved by providing long-range substantial goals for procurement by regulated public utilities of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work, especially in renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects, from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT businesses. (F) That procurement also benefits the regulated public utilities and consumers of the state by encouraging the expansion of the number of suppliers for procurements, thereby encouraging competition among the suppliers and promoting economic efficiency in the process. (G) That the long-term economic viability of this state depends substantially upon the ability of renewable energy, wireless telecommunications, broadband, smart grid, and rail projects to incorporate women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT businesses into those projects. (2) It is the purpose of this article to do all of the following: (A) Encourage greater economic opportunity for women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises. (B) Promote competition among regulated public utility suppliers in order to enhance economic efficiency in the procurement of electrical, gas, water, wireless telecommunications service provider, and telephone corporation contracts and contracts of their commission-regulated subsidiaries and affiliates. (C) Clarify and expand the program for the procurement by regulated public utilities of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises.","Declares it to be the policy of the state to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for regulated public utilities, including broadband, go to women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises.

Georgia,2018,Ga. Code-Ann. 50-40-80,Legislative Intent,,Legislative Findings,"(a)  The General Assembly recognizes that access to broadband services in today's society is essential to everyday life. Access to broadband services is a necessary service as fundamental as electricity, gas, or phone service. There is a growing need for the government of this state to provide the much needed infrastructure to the homes and businesses without access to broadband services due to their location in rural and other unserved areas. Furthermore, the General Assembly finds and declares that ensuring broadband services deployment will have a positive effect on education, health care, public safety, business and industry, government services, and leisure activities throughout the entire state. The General Assembly also finds and declares that guaranteeing an equitable deployment of broadband services throughout the state is a public necessity, one of the basic functions of government, and a benefit to the entire state. Moreover, the General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the best interest of the state and the persons who live and work in the state to spend state funds through the establishment of a grant program to ensure the creation of a state-wide foundation of broadband services infrastructure in unserved areas of the state. (b)  The General Assembly hereby finds and determines that the economic benefits that will inure to the State of Georgia and designated political subdivisions from the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative provided for in this article and from the performance by private sector persons and entities of the obligations that they will incur in connection with such Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative, will be equal to or greater than the benefits to be derived by such private sector persons and entities in connection therewith, and that, therefore, the Georgia Broadband Deployment Initiative does not violate the prohibition in the Georgia Constitution on the payment by public bodies of gratuities to private sector persons or entities.","Addresses legislative findings related to broadband, recognizing broadband as a necessary service essential to everyday life.

","Addresses small cell wireless facilities and essential to delivering wireless access and broadband services to homes, schools, and business in Illinois. Exempts a municipality with a population of 1,000,000 or more from the provisions of this Act.  Prohibits local governments from prohibiting, regulating, or charging for the collocation of small cell facilities. Requires that small cell facilities be classified as permitted uses and subject only to administrative review if they are in the right-of-way in any zone or outside the rights-of-way in property zoned for commercial or industrial use. Prohibits the local government from requiring unrelated services from the application, including in-kind contributions.  Allows the local government to request site specific structural integrity and a make-ready analysis for a utility pole, the location of each proposed facility and photographs of the utility pole and its immediate surroundings, specification types and drawings, and the make and model of equipment to be installed, as well as the proposed schedule for installation. However, the local government cannot require placement on any specific utility pole or category of poles.  Requires providers to comply with reasonable, technically feasible design measures in a historic district or on a historic landmark, but these requirements cannot have the effect of prohibiting the provider’s technology. Sets timelines for application review and allows up to 25 facilities to be submitted on a single application. Addresses maximum application fees for colocation and facilities that require new utilities.",http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3920&ChapterID=11

(b) Cable services and video services bring important daily benefits to Illinois consumers by providing news, education, and entertainment. (c) Competitive cable service and video service providers are capable of providing new video programming services and competition to Illinois consumers and of decreasing the prices for video programming services paid by Illinois consumers. (d) Although there has been some competitive entry into the facilities-based video programming market since current franchising requirements in this State were enacted, further entry by facilities-based providers could benefit consumers, provided cable and video services are equitably available to all Illinois consumers at reasonable prices. (e) The provision of competitive cable services and video services is a matter of statewide concern that extends beyond the boundaries of individual local units of government. Notwithstanding the foregoing, public rights-of-way are limited resources over which the municipality has a custodial duty to ensure that they are used, repaired, and maintained in a manner that best serves the public interest.

(g) Providing an incumbent cable or video service provider with the option to secure a State-issued authorization through the termination of existing cable franchises between incumbent cable and video service providers and any local franchising authority is part of the new regulatory framework established by this Article.

Texas,2005,Tex. Utilities Code 43.001 et seq.,SP - Other,,Legislative Findings," (a)  The legislature finds that broadband over power lines, also known as BPL, is an emerging technology platform that offers a means of providing broadband services to reach homes and businesses.  BPL services can also be used to enhance existing electric delivery systems, which can result in improved service and reliability for electric customers.(b)  The legislature finds that access to quality, high speed broadband services is important to this state.  BPL deployment in Texas has the potential to extend broadband service to customers where broadband access is currently not available and may provide an additional option for existing broadband consumers in Texas, resulting in a more competitive market for broadband services.  The legislature further finds that BPL development in Texas is fully dependent upon the participation of electric utilities in this state that own and operate power lines and related facilities that are necessary for the construction of BPL systems and the provision of BPL services. (c)  Consistent with the goal of increasing options for telecommunications in this state, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the deployment of BPL by permitting affiliates of the electric utility, or permitting unaffiliated entities, to own or operate all or a portion of such BPL systems.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide the appropriate framework to support the deployment of BPL. (d)  The legislature finds that an electric utility may choose to implement BPL under the procedures set forth in this chapter, but is not required to do so.  The electric utility shall have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to implement BPL and may not be penalized for deciding to implement or not to implement BPL.","Addresses broadband over power lines (BPL) as an emerging technology that can help expand broadband service to underserved areas, while also enhancing electric delivery systems.
