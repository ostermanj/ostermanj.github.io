Your content needs to work for all of your audience
===================================================

Most of your audience isn't reading your blog. Or your report. Or your About Us page. The're skimming.

You do it and I do itâ€”we're all skimmers on the internet, but many organizations still publish for a world of readers. Buried ledes. Long paragraphs. No interactives. PDFs.

Turning skimmers into readers, readers into sharers, and sharers into advocates takes content that engages all levels of your audience, from the casual retweeter to serious researcher or policymaker.

You don't need a large budget or digital team to do it. It takes some planning and changing how you think about your outputs. I can help with the planning and execution of online communications projects tailored for your organization, your audience, and your goals.
