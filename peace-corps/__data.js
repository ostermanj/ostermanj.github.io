The guitar was big. The fretboard was large for my hands and the action was really high. I struggled with it, but I played enough to form calluses on my fingertips and bring chords that had seemed impossible into reach. I certainly got better over time, but still my journey was largely an intellectual one.  I was fascinated by the tension and resolution in a standard 1-4-5 chord progression and stumbled upon the fact that, starting with C Major, the fifth note of any given major key was the root of the key with one more sharp note, each being a half-step down from the root's octave. C Major has zero sharps, G Major has one (F#), D Major has two (F# and C#), and so on. When I mentioned this to a fellow volunteer who knew music and guitar, he was like, \"Oh yeah, that's the Circle of Fifths!\" I was at once proud to have discovered something so fundamental but frustrated that it took so much time and work to get there on my own.\n\nI also stumbled upon different chord voicings, though I didn't have the vocabulary to explain it:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\n27 October 2002\n\nI've made a  lot of progress on the guitar. I've gotten comfortable with a couple new chord progression and have started doing barre chords, so now my potential has really expanded. I've still been working a lot on rhythm and that is coming, especially by using the quick-muting strum. And I've discovered something about different voicings of chords. Some chord progressions [sic—what I meant is voicings] are naturally in the normal order with the first degree lowest, the fourth [I meant third] next, and the fifth highest. G B D, for example [i.e., G Major]. But some are inverted … and resolve differently\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nLooking back, it's clear to me now that I was interested in guitar—very interested!—and that interest was very satisfying, but I wasn't doing what I needed to do to become fluent. Like someone studying a language without the goal of communicating, I confined myself to practicing musical conjugations and building vocabulary for a language I would never truly speak.

[There's a small protest in town.]\n\nI found out after dawn that there'd been gunshots and explosions at the presidential palace. Later it was clear: Mauritania was in the middle of a coup. A faction of the military pissed off about all the recent arrests of islamists and other \"enemies of the state\" were trying to seize power. They'd flown a plane by the palace and it was fired on by anti-aircraft artillery. They had tanks. There were loud, building-shaking explosions and the underwater pop-pop-pop of far-off automatic gunfire.\n\nI was at the Arc en Ciel residence and couldn't budge. We watched TV and listened to the BBC and heard the explosions, some of which seemed too close for comfort.\n\nMidafternoon, we get a message: pack your bags to go to the bureau. I get a call shortly after that and I say we're ready. No more than a couple minutes after that, K___ is banging on the door. We open it and she asks what the hell are you waiting for? Throw you your shit in the car and get in.\n\nWe speed off to the bureau and get in with our bags as if we're in a warzone. We were all surprised by her urgency. She's trying to be responsible and cautious, and we had trouble, I think, realizing how dangerous the situation was.\n\nWe've been at the bureau ever since, unable to leave. This is our third night here. \n\nI should have been in Dakar by now, but coups disrupt things. I should still be able to make my flight, though by flying to Dakar tomorrow.\n\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\nThe next day I did make my flight despite fears that damage to a runway might have disrupted flights. I didn't write much more about it, but there are a few things I remember about the coup that aren't in my journal.\n\nOne: like idiots, we went up the roof of the Arc en Ciel to see if we could see anything. Explosions and gunfire were so far off that we seemed very much out of harm's way. Until—BANG!—a bone-shaking explosion sent us scrambling back down.\n\nTwo: I called the bureau after that to say that explosions seemed to be getting closer. Maybe it was time to come get us. While I was on the line, I heard another explosion, but first through the phone before it reached my ears through the air. \"Nevermind,\" I said. \"They're closer to you.\"\n\nThree: rumor had it that the would-be revolutionaries' plans leaked and they were forced to begin the coup before they were ready and properly armed. Their tanks were firing blanks for most of the day until they got that sorted. I remember thinking that made sense: at first, we just heard far-off booms but now real explosions; only later were the booms followed by bangs. True? Who knows.\n\nThere is [a little information](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002F2003_Mauritanian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt) about the whole thing online.\n",snippet:"I found out after dawn that there'd been gunshots and explosions at the presidential palace.

We'd been preparing mentally to be evacuated ever since September 11. In the weeks just after the attacks, when we were all huddled together at the \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaison\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in Nouakchott, a fellow volunteer known for histrionics (you know who you are! lol) burst into a room where we were playing mafia or some such thing and said, \"I just heard from the bureau! The US has bombed Damascus and we've been ordered to evacuate. Time to pack your bags!\"\n\nWe all believed him. That was exactly how it was going to happen.\n\nEighteen months later, it did happen, only it wasn't Damascus getting bombed but Baghdad. In the end we weren't evacuated, but I believe we came close. Things certainly got a little wild.\n\nWe all thought we'd be sent home once the war started, and we'd been waiting for it for a long time. The BBC World Service reported each fractional step closer to war for months. That was my early-21st-century version of doom scrolling: breaking out my shortwave radio every hour on the hour to take part in the slow build toward catastrophe. While we expected protests borne of Arab solidarity and latent anti-Americanism, the only aggression I witnessed was an old lady cursing me and spitting at my feet. Was that because of Iraq? Hard to know.\n\nNonetheless, on March 18 armed local police started guarding our homes in Aioun. The next day, when the bombing began, the police started following us around town, which made visiting people or going to the market a little awkward. It didn't last long. The head of police for the region or town decided to consolidate all the foreigners together. The Germans all went to a German expat's place; the French and Americans all went to a French expat's. Believe me, there were worse places to be. We already knew his place very well. We'd gather there for dinner parties, to swim in his pool, to drink and smoke cigarettes, and to watch TV. It was a decadent, epicurean oasis.\n\nWe were in our decadent house arrest for nearly a week when things got weird and uncanny. At first, it was just us four Peace Corps volunteers and one of the French volunteers, enjoying the hospitality of our gracious host. Then another French volunteer showed up. Then a French guy on a motorcycle showed up. Then two Swedish tourists showed up. Basically, any non-German foreigner passing through Aioun—usually a rare event!—was put under house arrest with us. We nine uninvited houseguests lived together for a few days, vying for sleeping space, sharing wine, hoping to wait out the threat so that we could go our various ways.\n\nOur momentary life of luxury wasn't exactly without care. In general, I was ready to go. I'd basically completed my service. But specifically, there were a lot of things I hadn't done. I didn't have many souvenirs; I had no pictures of my students; I had had no closure with anyone I would have wanted closure with. Despite the pool and the booze and other comforts of my enclosure, it was stressful to see my service potentially end with such a whimper. Plus one of the French guys came down with malaria, left to go to the hospital, and came back later, IV bag in tow, to sleep off his fever for a few days. Fun times.\n\nAfter four days the Wali decided that the Americans should go to Nouakchott. He called the bureau to ask them to get us out of Aioun, and they agreed to either charter a plane or have us get on the next commercial flight to the capital. For some reason the plane never showed up, and it was a few days later before a Peace Corp vehicle arrived with its logos long ago removed. We were to leave town at 4:30 the next morning to avoid trouble.\n\nMy memory of what happened next is dim. My journal skips 10 days. My next entry is a largely illegible poem about doubt, confusion, and frustration rising from a romantic pursuit, which means that we volunteers were together again in Nouakchott. A few days later the option was out: for the second time during my service (the first was after September 11) any volunteer who wanted to leave Mauritania (early terminate) could do so without repercussion and perhaps continue their service elsewhere. At that point I only had less than two months to go, so I stayed.\n\nI returned to Aioun around April 22. Protests and threats in response to the invasion of Iraq never amounted to much. It was good to be back, to get back to my routine and to teaching, and to trying to do Peace Corps in a time of war. I don't know what my students did while I was gone, whether a fellow teacher covered for me or if the kids just had some extra free time, but there was some extra writing on the wall, caricatures of George Bush and graffiti calling him a dog. I didn't disagree but I pretended not to notice.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Bush dog](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EI returned to Aioun to some new graffiti in the classroom.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Bush dog](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F6wGHos2mAVj6mDUSACruZC\u002F95c4be2425a5920a2917910cf95c89d2\u002Fbush-dog2_r.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EBush is \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Eterroriste\u003C\u002Fi\u003E.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nThe next weeks—my last weeks—went quickly. I witnessed no further aggression or protests. My students were nice and thankful that I tried to teach some of them English. They, like most people, could like a person and disdain their government without suffering cognitive dissonance. Perhaps my presence tempered some ill will toward my country. Perhaps it heightened it. I don't know.\n\nEither way, on May 31, 2003, my mission really was accomplished.\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\nMay 31, 2003\n\nI just woke up: my last full day in Aioun. It rained last night, the first thing past a drizzle for the season. I woke from the wind and saw nothing in the sky. An ominous dark shielding the usual night glow. The possibility of rain didn't cross my mind; I fell back asleep to awake sometime later to the drops on my forehead. Rain.\n\nAnd it smelled like rain, too, like earth, like wet cereal.\n\nThe rain grew steady and the wind was blowing into the porch. I had to move all the way inside where it was too warm to properly sleep. I drifted in and out with new visions each time I closed my eyes. Flashlights in the yard, a woman in bed, my homecoming back in the States.\n\nI awaken to quiet. The rain has slowed. I move back out to the porch where the breeze is pleasant and cool. It's dark, nearly completely so, and I go to fill my buckets for bath and drinking water. It must be near 4 a.m. The water comes pretty strongly.\n\nReplete, I stumble back to my matela and collapse. Soon the sun comes. Then the flies, then the goats, and I have no choice but to begin my last day in Aioun.\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\n![Mission accomplished](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F4LKNIB7XyC4933wqoGS57J\u002F17c242bdfae3b53e512b49df3e296dd5\u002Fclassroom_mission-accomplished.jpg)",snippet:"In early 2003, the drumbeat of a war was reaching a fever pitch and things in Mauritania were getting tense.

There were times, in the evenings especially, when the heat and dust of the day had settled, when I could sit out on my mat with a book or letter or journal and appreciate Tintane's beauty. My house was elevated a bit up a hill and looked down on the expanse below. The wadi below would fill after rains and was surrounded by gardens and date palms. Beyond that was more houses and sandy scrubland bordered finally by the face of plateaus against the horizon.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![View from Tintane](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F3Cn8fUXS1xqiKrXdZNmKAP\u002Ffd02fb2695701afb572a377e15a1262e\u002Fview-from-tintane.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003EThe view from my house in Tintane.

Since most of my journal entries are about the not-so-good days, I'm lucky I wrote about this one.\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\nFebruary 28, 2002\n\nThis place is really nice. I rediscovered my late afternoon hobby of sitting on my mat as the sun goes down, and it's nice.\n\nThe air is clear and still. Clouds define the usually distanceless blue—hard contoured lines wisped back like great tines in the sky.\n\nThought's come to me a few times the past couple days: Tintane could be paradise. If it weren't for the trash, animal shit (and animal carcasses), and bad food, Tintane would be incredible.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nThe plateaus off in the distance were always bone dry every time I made the trek out there, but there was evidence of either a much wetter past or thousands of years of accumulated erosion from infrequent rain. Some escarpments had smoothed out chutes carved all the down, about the width of a person. It's a good thing no one had a skateboard because I probably would have tried rolling down, just for fun. Having fun in Mauritania often involved an element of danger.\n\nOn March 2, with my good mood still in full effect, I took a day trek out to the plateau. I left with a bag full of water bottles, some snacks, a loaf of bread and a tin of sardines. I made notes on the way out of where there were water wells in case I needed some emergency water supplies. The wells seemed to be used mostly for watering cattle and camels and would almost certainly make me sick, but in the wise words of our Peace Corps doctor, in case of emergency \"drink now, treat later.\"\n\nAs is often the case, I don't have photos of this trek, or at least I can't find them. I thought I had a picture of some rock art I found on the protected underside of a boulder out there. It was a collection of small geometric designs, maybe eight inches wide each in dark red pigment. One was a circle divided into quarters. There are some extensive rock art sites in Mauritania (see the [Trust for African Rock Art](https:\u002F\u002Fafricanrockart.org\u002Fmauritania\u002F) for examples); what I saw was similar in style but nonfigurative and on a much smaller scale.\n\nOn the way home, I began to wonder whether I really would need to draw some water from the wells. I was fatigued and running a little low. I wrote about it the next day:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nMarch 3, 2002\n\nI overdid it yesterday. Went to the mountain again. Fun, and pleasantly solitary, but too much walking. It's almost too much for a day trip.\n\nOn the way back I had to keep myself from stopping to sit down. My toes have blisters. My heel split. It hurts to walk.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nApparently that's all I had to say about it. Heel splitting sounds dramatic—and it is painful—but it happened to me several times since I did nothing to care for the thick shell of dry skin that the desert gave my flip-flopped feet. And wasn't enough to end my good mood. That came crashing down the next day.\n\nMy March 4 journal entry begins: \"My good mood is over.\" I'll keep the rest to myself, at least for now.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Aching feet](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2EyeQCdTp9vcSJPPhQnFGP\u002F0f7adaba5754ce530c32957d72d8008c\u002Faching-feet.jpg)\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\n  My feet after a hike: dry, calloused, and blistered.\n  \u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E",snippet:"February 28, 2002, was one of those good days when I had time to just sit and think about how incredible and satisfying it felt to be so far from home, still alive, still breathing, still myself.",heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:c}},id:"3Cn8fUXS1xqiKrXdZNmKAP",type:h,createdAt:G,updatedAt:G,environment:{sys:{id:d,type:a,linkType:e}},revision:g,locale:f},fields:{title:"View from Tintane",description:"View of a mud-brick building in an arid landscape.

Social media generally makes me less happy now; I can't imagine it would have improved my life back then.\n\nI kept in touch with family and friends back home mostly by writing letters and occasionally emailing and calling home when I traveled to bigger towns, where some corner stores had public pay phones. The connection was always bad and had a long delay, up to maybe two or three seconds—enough to make conversation difficult. The line clicked every few seconds, counting up the cost of the call in real time. Some piece of analog wizardry would display the total number of clicks at the end of the call. \n\nSometimes the delay was so bad we'd take to saying \"over\" at the end of every statement to avoid awkwardly talking over each other all the time.\n\n\"I'm in Kiffa and doing well, over.\"\n\n\"Are you healthy?

I could know what's going on with the PC crew, and during the really hard times I could get in touch with someone.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nSeveral weeks later, I had one. It happened quickly. The towers went up, stores with phones and SIM cards appeared in the market, and soon it seemed like everyone had a cell phone. I got one pretty quickly, too. The Peace Corps paid for it since it was a basic safety advantage to be able to get in touch directly in case of emergency\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nMarch 12, 2002\n\nI've got a cell phone now, which is the strangest thing in these surroundings. It doesn't change things much—I can't afford to really talk to people very much, but for safety, making plans, and keeping in touch, it's nice.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nMy stipend wasn't enough to burn through minutes like crazy, and my Mauritanian neighbors for the most part didn't have money to keep their credits up either. At the time, you paid only for outgoing calls so people quickly learned to call and hang up in the hopes that the other person—the loser—would call back. \n\nHaving the cell phone did give some peace of mind, but I remember feeling this absurd disappointment when it didn't just start ringing out of blue, as if my friends and family should have magically known my phone number and rushed to get in touch. Its silence was more wrenching than its absence. I tried calling home on it a few times, but the connections were worse than the landline; eventually I used it only for domestic calls. \n\nHaving a phone and, later, easier access to email didn't replace writing letters. They served different purposes. Phone calls were too quick: useful for check-ins and for hearing someone's voice, but they couldn't match the deliberateness and thoroughness of writing. Now, though, twenty years later, taking the time to talk to someone on the phone seems like a quaint,  old-fashioned pursuit.

We stopped for evening prayers and to have some tea on the side of the route. Night fell as we got back in and the landscape took on a peaceful monochromatic glow. A long lingering twilight silhouetted gentle waves of dunes. We floated on tires deflated for travel in sand. The moon eventually rose and cast everything in soft, shallow relief, underexposed and underdeveloped. As I fell in and out of sleep, whether from tiredness or carbon monoxide I do not know, the rickety 4x4 I was in transformed into a sleigh and the sand to snow. The smell of woodsmoke from cooking fires gave me visions instead of chimneys and cold nights back home. I thought of storybook winter villages. I thought of Christmas.\n\nMy winter dreamstate dissolved when we stopped. Kankosso was dark. It had no electricity, and that was in fact part of what I was excited about. In Tintane, electricity helped me read at night but otherwise made life more frustrating. My host family—my food family really—had satellite TV and watched it constantly. Who can blame them? It was a luxury and neighbors would come over to watch, but for me it was a maddening waste of time. I couldn't understand it and it engrossed my companions so completely that all conversation was stifled. Al Jazeera news, weird soap operas about the crusades, and me trying to ignore it all to focus on reading or my vocabulary flash cards.\n\nIn Kankossa, the quiet was welcome. By day there was lake Kankossa  bordered abruptly by tall sand dunes. There were gardens and date groves along the water. The people were kind. By night, the sky was dark behind the Milky Way. We read by lantern light. The walls of the group house in Kankossa had graffiti from decades of Peace Corp volunteers who'd passed through before, leaving messages for their successors. It felt historical and magical.\n\nThe contrast with Tintane was stark. I'd been forming a theory about it: too big to be a village and too small to be a town, Tintane had the benefits of neither. Kankossa had the charm of a small village. I wrote about it after returning to Tintane:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nDecember 29, 2001\n\nI've just returned from an extended trip to Kiffa and Kankossa. It was good.

What more is needed?\n\nI had a lot of time to think about what had been bothering me and I think I've found some motivation to turn things around. Yes, I think Tintane is a hard site, with obstacles somehow that other sites may not have, but I will try to make the best of it. I'm sure I'll write more on it later. Now, I'm off to the market to avoid being in my room.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nThe sense of optimism must have been my Christmas present that year. Like a child, I played with it for a day or two and then grew tired of it. A couple days later and I found myself exactly where I was before, venting to myself in my journals about the same old frustrations. But one realization did stick with me: I did have an especially hard site. It was a slow realization that crystallized the more I visited other volunteers throughout Mauritania. While the frustrations didn't really lessen much until I left Tintane for Aioun, at least I was beginning to blame myself less for them.\n\nAnd that truly was a gift.\n",snippet:"The contrast with Tintane was stark.

I knew it at the time, and my journal is full of little snippets of advice to myself, micro resolutions that I rarely adhered to. Like this:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\nDecember 11, 2001\n\n* You will never learn a language if you don't seek out people to speak with.\n* Staying in your room so much can do nothing but harm.\n* Stop avoiding people.\n* Stop listening to the radio so much, especially in English. If noise is necessary, find French.\n* Find some French books to read.\n* Always question your first reaction.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nReading was indeed a pleasure, and it was sort of a guilty one. It was solitary when I was supposed to be out talking to people and doing crosscultural things. I felt guilty about immersing myself in English after investing so much time and effort to learn another language. Sometimes I did try reading books in French instead but I couldn't do so without looking up dozens of words per page. And that damn \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Epassé simple\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, right? Never worked out.\n\nDespite that guilt, I read a lot of books in Mauritania. I had a lot of downtime, and books provided a needed escape from everyday difficulties. Besides, there weren't many other sources of easy entertainment. I would tune my shortwave radio to the BBC World Service for maybe  an hour a day but otherwise entertainment was either listening to one of the handful of cassette tapes I brought with me or reading. And reading won out, probably for hours a day. Strangely, though, I don't remember many of them. The \u003Ccite\u003EGrapes of Wrath\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E, \u003Ccite\u003ECaptain Corelli's Mandolin\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E, \u003Ccite\u003ECold Mountain\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E. Three come to mind? There were scores more, and I wish I could remember them all.\n\nHundreds of mostly paperbacks floated around among volunteers and lined bookshelves throughout the country. In Nouakchott, the capital, we had, until the very end of my service, a house where all volunteers would stay when they were in town. Most regional capitals had one too, and in some other towns volunteers would pool money for a shared space. They were called \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaisons de passage\u003C\u002Fi\u003E; we weren't supposed to live in them (we were supposed to be with host families in our posts), but we'd find ways to extend our stays. Each \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaison\u003C\u002Fi\u003E had a stash of books. You'd leave the ones you came with and take some before you left. Some \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaisons\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in far-off places had venerated, less picked-over collections.\n\nSo English it was, and whatever guilt I felt was no match for the allure of a good escape. Plus there's this: reading books was *better* for me there than it was before or has been since. I had enough time to become immersed in the stories and finish them without struggling to recall what was going on or having to reread chapters. But more than that, books just seemed more vivid somehow.\n\n**Descriptions of villages and animals roaming around**—yes, I know it.\n\n**Heartache, loneliness**—yes, I feel it.\n\n**Beauty, harshness, death**—yes, I see it.\n\nMy mind was primed by need or by exposure to otherworldliness to follow their lead. Stripped of most other distractions, I was vulnerable to their stories. Now, yes, I still read, but it hasn't been the same since. Maybe that's good—a sign of a healthier mental state—but it's also from having too little time and too many easy, stupid distractions. \n\nSo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n\nDecember 7, 2022\n\n* Read more books.\n",snippet:"Reading books in Mauritania was better than it was before or has been since.

I was in the midst of what might have been my hardest stretch in Mauritania. My first year teaching had just started. I hadn't yet figured out how to have any independence from my host family. I was sleep deprived from guests hanging out, loudly, until the middle of the night. It was Ramadan. Many volunteers were leaving the country, accepting the early termination offered in the wake of September 11.  All these things each deserve paragraphs of their own but for now let's just say my moods were all over the place. My second journal actually opens on November 18 with this admonishment to myself: \"avoid cataloging mood swings—your last journal is not very flattering.\"\n\nKinda harsh. That's the journal that went missing somehow—tragically, inexplicably—so I'll never know again just how bad it was.\n\nIt's clear, though, that I did not take my own advice. Within days the second journal ping-pongs from timid optimism to despair and back again in the four days between its first entry and Thanksgiving. It captures a thoughtful description of a graveyard along the path to school, a lukewarm description of my first class (\"It went pretty well\"), an angry rant about being kept up at night, and a near celebration after meeting and hanging out with two other teachers. One Pulaar and the other Wolof, they were Mauritanian but not from around Tintane. What I understood at the time was that new teachers would be sent to teach far away from their homes as some sort of anticorruption measure. True or not, they felt like outsiders and we connected on that basis.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n  ![Sleeping platform](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg)\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EWhere I slept during my first months in Tintane.

A___ offered to take my class the next day, which gave me time to travel to Aioun for Thanksgiving. And so it was I spent my first Thanksgiving in Mauritania improvising strange dishes with few ingredients and fewer kitchen appliances and getting acquainted with our newfound low level of alcohol tolerance:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nNovember 25, 2001\n\nWe had a veritable feast and party afterwards.

The volunteers here really look out for each other, and it's a great feeling to be part of that. . . .\n\nAfter such a festive weekend, I dreaded coming back to Tintane, but so far so good. Walking into my compound felt like coming home. So far my outlook is good, but I don't want to speak too soon.

Why it didn't just stay in the latrine is something I didn't think to wonder about until now.\n\nHassaniya is an Arabic language brought to the region by the Beni Hassan tribe in the 15th century. It's spoken, not written. Mauritanians learn Standard Arabic in school, and many of them were amused that we would write Hassaniya down. That's how we learned: by listening and transcribing into our notebooks. It's to the Peace Corps' credit that they taught language in a way that really worked—intensely, immersed in the community, and with a real sense of priority of what needed to be taught first.\n\nOur language lessons were part of our community-based training. My cohort included education volunteers (of which I was one) and small-enterprise-development volunteers. We were in Boghé, along the Senegal river in the southwest of the country; our SED friends were in Kaédi, about 100 kilometers southeast. Each group would spend maybe ten days at a time with their host families and going to language lessons before all coming back to Boghé for days together at the training center outside of town.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![mosquito nets](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F6qU2YdjWh47InndA2BvlNe\u002Ffd2500368f3f4fcd61c2b9d913af4156\u002Fmosquito-nets.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003EMosquito nets set up around the foam mattresses I and fellow volunteers slept on at the training center in Boghé.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nMy host family during training spoke Hassaniya but was culturally more affiliated with Senegal. One of my host-sisters spoke French and was the only person I could communicate with much at all. Other than that, in the early days I was rendered completely incompetent by language and cultural differences. Unable to speak and still learning to eat properly, I felt a connection with the months-old infant of the family who spent time lying on her back mindlessly staring at the sky, much as I myself did.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![baby](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EThe baby with whom I shared comparable linguistic ability.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nWe got up to speed quickly, though. Language lessons were intense. There were two sessions a day, two or three hours in the morning and another two or three in the afternoon. In between it was too hot to do much except commune with the infants. My group had one teacher and four other volunteers. We would gather under a shade tree, notebooks in one hand and Nalgene bottles of treated well water in the other, and stumble through role plays and monologues, practicing greetings (which were varied and could seem endless), descriptions of our families back home, and explanations of why we were in Mauritania in the first place. Numbers, days of the week, months; transportation and how to ask for help; illnesses, thirst, and hunger. While a child's brain is like a sponge for soaking up languages, mine at 23 felt like a dishrag being twisted dry at the end of every day. It was getting the job done but not without some pain. I came, in time, to like that feeling, complete mental exhaustion offset somewhat by the buzz of learning so much. Only language learning feels like that.\n\nIn the end, my Hassaniya was okay. I could speak better than I could understand, and so I spent a large part of my two years mildly confused at all times. The truly proficient could wield idioms and proverbs at will, to the delight of their Mauritanian friends. I could never keep them straight for some reason, even though they were rich and colorful. There were stories about hyenas and bandits and voyages and vagabonds, and while it may be true that drop by drop the wadi fills with water, it was at times too much for my mind to hold.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Notebook page](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\n  A page from the beginning of my Hassaniya notebook, dated June 13, 2001.

That meant having other Peace Corps Volunteers nearby and an internet cafe. It meant more dependable water and even a restaurant or two. It meant a handful of French and German expats to hang out with. And it meant a better school (in some ways) and more understanding school administrators.\n\nMy assignment was to teach English to high-school students, and my primary qualification for the job was being a native speaker. We were trained, to be clear, but it was not and could not have been enough to prepare us for the task. In Tintane, I taught three classes of very likable kids who seemed to believe—rightly so, I think—that learning English wasn't going to do much for them. And they acted accordingly. It was complete mayhem at times: Everyone out of their seats running around and making jokes. Rampant cheating on quizzes. Days when no one showed up.
