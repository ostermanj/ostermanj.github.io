I was in the midst of what might have been my hardest stretch in Mauritania. My first year teaching had just started. I hadn't yet figured out how to have any independence from my host family. I was sleep deprived from guests hanging out, loudly, until the middle of the night. It was Ramadan. Many volunteers were leaving the country, accepting the early termination offered in the wake of September 11.  All these things each deserve paragraphs of their own but for now let's just say my moods were all over the place. My second journal actually opens on November 18 with this admonishment to myself: \"avoid cataloging mood swings—your last journal is not very flattering.\"\n\nKinda harsh. That's the journal that went missing somehow—tragically, inexplicably—so I'll never know again just how bad it was.\n\nIt's clear, though, that I did not take my own advice. Within days the second journal ping-pongs from timid optimism to despair and back again in the four days between its first entry and Thanksgiving. It captures a thoughtful description of a graveyard along the path to school, a lukewarm description of my first class (\"It went pretty well\"), an angry rant about being kept up at night, and a near celebration after meeting and hanging out with two other teachers. One Pulaar and the other Wolof, they were Mauritanian but not from around Tintane. What I understood at the time was that new teachers would be sent to teach far away from their homes as some sort of anticorruption measure. True or not, they felt like outsiders and we connected on that basis.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n  ![Sleeping platform](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg)\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EWhere I slept during my first months in Tintane.

A___ offered to take my class the next day, which gave me time to travel to Aioun for Thanksgiving. And so it was I spent my first Thanksgiving in Mauritania improvising strange dishes with few ingredients and fewer kitchen appliances and getting acquainted with our newfound low level of alcohol tolerance:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nNovember 25, 2001\n\nWe had a veritable feast and party afterwards. Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, squash, seafood chowder, and dessert. Oh, and the rounds and rounds of french fry appetizers that G____ and I fried over a wood fire.\n\nThe food was incredible. I actually had the post-Thanksgiving fullness by the end, and it was clearer to me this year more than any other what really is important, what to be thankful for.\n\nD___ passed out early, around six, right of the cement of the porch. He was out cold for hours before reviving and going at it some more. He passes out all the time.\n\n[...]\n\nYesterday of course was my birthday. Except for saying goodbye to An____, it too was really good. My friends (God bless them) made me a Mexican lunch. The volunteers here really look out for each other, and it's a great feeling to be part of that. . . .\n\nAfter such a festive weekend, I dreaded coming back to Tintane, but so far so good. Walking into my compound felt like coming home. So far my outlook is good, but I don't want to speak too soon. If I've learned anything lately, it's that my moods are endlessly changeable and not necessarily understandable. I will try to hold onto this feeling.\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E",snippet:L,heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:c}},id:M,type:g,createdAt:o,updatedAt:o,environment:{sys:{id:d,type:a,linkType:e}},revision:j,locale:f},fields:{title:N,description:O,file:{url:P,details:{size:Q,image:{width:R,height:S}},fileName:T,contentType:h}}},slug:U}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:c}},id:"5dk9hf2HrD3UXkqXTkLwgT",type:l,createdAt:"2022-11-09T02:29:06.697Z",updatedAt:"2022-11-09T02:50:04.885Z",environment:{sys:{id:d,type:a,linkType:e}},revision:s,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:m,id:k}},locale:f},fields:{authors:[r],title:"Learning Hassaniya",datePublished:"2022-11-08",body:"One of the first phrases I learned in Hassaniya was *mnayn makaresh*, which can be best translated as \"where's the butt pot?\" You'd ask that when you had to go to the latrine; the *makaresh* was the teapot–like vessel used to pour water in lieu of using toilet paper. Why it didn't just stay in the latrine is something I didn't think to wonder about until now.\n\nHassaniya is an Arabic language brought to the region by the Beni Hassan tribe in the 15th century. It's spoken, not written. Mauritanians learn Standard Arabic in school, and many of them were amused that we would write Hassaniya down. That's how we learned: by listening and transcribing into our notebooks. It's to the Peace Corps' credit that they taught language in a way that really worked—intensely, immersed in the community, and with a real sense of priority of what needed to be taught first.\n\nOur language lessons were part of our community-based training. My cohort included education volunteers (of which I was one) and small-enterprise-development volunteers. We were in Boghé, along the Senegal river in the southwest of the country; our SED friends were in Kaédi, about 100 kilometers southeast. Each group would spend maybe ten days at a time with their host families and going to language lessons before all coming back to Boghé for days together at the training center outside of town.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![mosquito nets](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F6qU2YdjWh47InndA2BvlNe\u002Ffd2500368f3f4fcd61c2b9d913af4156\u002Fmosquito-nets.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003EMosquito nets set up around the foam mattresses I and fellow volunteers slept on at the training center in Boghé.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nMy host family during training spoke Hassaniya but was culturally more affiliated with Senegal. One of my host-sisters spoke French and was the only person I could communicate with much at all. Other than that, in the early days I was rendered completely incompetent by language and cultural differences. Unable to speak and still learning to eat properly, I felt a connection with the months-old infant of the family who spent time lying on her back mindlessly staring at the sky, much as I myself did.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![baby](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EThe baby with whom I shared comparable linguistic ability.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nWe got up to speed quickly, though. Language lessons were intense. There were two sessions a day, two or three hours in the morning and another two or three in the afternoon. In between it was too hot to do much except commune with the infants. My group had one teacher and four other volunteers. We would gather under a shade tree, notebooks in one hand and Nalgene bottles of treated well water in the other, and stumble through role plays and monologues, practicing greetings (which were varied and could seem endless), descriptions of our families back home, and explanations of why we were in Mauritania in the first place. Numbers, days of the week, months; transportation and how to ask for help; illnesses, thirst, and hunger. While a child's brain is like a sponge for soaking up languages, mine at 23 felt like a dishrag being twisted dry at the end of every day. It was getting the job done but not without some pain. I came, in time, to like that feeling, complete mental exhaustion offset somewhat by the buzz of learning so much. Only language learning feels like that.\n\nIn the end, my Hassaniya was okay. I could speak better than I could understand, and so I spent a large part of my two years mildly confused at all times. The truly proficient could wield idioms and proverbs at will, to the delight of their Mauritanian friends. I could never keep them straight for some reason, even though they were rich and colorful. There were stories about hyenas and bandits and voyages and vagabonds, and while it may be true that drop by drop the wadi fills with water, it was at times too much for my mind to hold.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Notebook page](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\n  A page from the beginning of my Hassaniya notebook, dated June 13, 2001.

But things were on an upward trend, and I was looking forward to my second year. I had left my first town, Tintane, for the relative cosmopolitan allure of the regional capital, Aioun. That meant having other Peace Corps Volunteers nearby and an internet cafe. It meant more dependable water and even a restaurant or two. It meant a handful of French and German expats to hang out with. And it meant a better school (in some ways) and more understanding school administrators.\n\nMy assignment was to teach English to high-school students, and my primary qualification for the job was being a native speaker. We were trained, to be clear, but it was not and could not have been enough to prepare us for the task. In Tintane, I taught three classes of very likable kids who seemed to believe—rightly so, I think—that learning English wasn't going to do much for them. And they acted accordingly. It was complete mayhem at times: Everyone out of their seats running around and making jokes. Rampant cheating on quizzes. Days when no one showed up.

I was in the midst of what might have been my hardest stretch in Mauritania. My first year teaching had just started. I hadn’t yet figured out how to have any independence from my host family. I was sleep deprived from guests hanging out, loudly, until the middle of the night. It was Ramadan. Many volunteers were leaving the country, accepting the early termination offered in the wake of September 11.  All these things each deserve paragraphs of their own but for now let’s just say my moods were all over the place.

Within days the second journal ping-pongs from timid optimism to despair and back again in the four days between its first entry and Thanksgiving. It captures a thoughtful description of a graveyard along the path to school, a lukewarm description of my first class (“It went pretty well”), an angry rant about being kept up at night, and a near celebration after meeting and hanging out with two other teachers. One Pulaar and the other Wolof, they were Mauritanian but not from around Tintane. What I understood at the time was that new teachers would be sent to teach far away from their homes as some sort of anticorruption measure. True or not, they felt like outsiders and we connected on that basis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\u003Cpicture\u003E\n        \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=avif&w=1480&h=997&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=avif&w=740&h=499&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=avif&w=800&h=539&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=avif&w=400&h=270&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\"\u003E\u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=webp&w=1480&h=997&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=webp&w=740&h=499&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=webp&w=800&h=539&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg?fm=webp&w=400&h=270&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\"\u003E\n        \u003Cimg load=\"lazy\" class=\"full\" src=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg\" width=\"3496px\" height=\"2356px\" alt=\"A hangar, or semipermanent tent, with a wooden sleeping platform underneath.\" \u002F\u003E\n    \u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EWhere I slept during my first months in Tintane.
