I knew it at the time, and my journal is full of little snippets of advice to myself, micro resolutions that I rarely adhered to. Like this:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\nDecember 11, 2001\n\n* You will never learn a language if you don't seek out people to speak with.\n* Staying in your room so much can do nothing but harm.\n* Stop avoiding people.\n* Stop listening to the radio so much, especially in English. If noise is necessary, find French.\n* Find some French books to read.\n* Always question your first reaction.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nReading was indeed a pleasure, and it was sort of a guilty one. It was solitary when I was supposed to be out talking to people and doing crosscultural things. I felt guilty about immersing myself in English after investing so much time and effort to learn another language. Sometimes I did try reading books in French instead but I couldn't do so without looking up dozens of words per page. And that damn \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Epassé simple\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, right? Never worked out.\n\nDespite that guilt, I read a lot of books in Mauritania. I had a lot of downtime, and books provided a needed escape from everyday difficulties. Besides, there weren't many other sources of easy entertainment. I would tune my shortwave radio to the BBC World Service for maybe  an hour a day but otherwise entertainment was either listening to one of the handful of cassette tapes I brought with me or reading. And reading won out, probably for hours a day. Strangely, though, I don't remember many of them. The \u003Ccite\u003EGrapes of Wrath\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E, \u003Ccite\u003ECaptain Corelli's Mandolin\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E, \u003Ccite\u003ECold Mountain\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E. Three come to mind? There were scores more, and I wish I could remember them all.\n\nHundreds of mostly paperbacks floated around among volunteers and lined bookshelves throughout the country. In Nouakchott, the capital, we had, until the very end of my service, a house where all volunteers would stay when they were in town. Most regional capitals had one too, and in some other towns volunteers would pool money for a shared space. They were called \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaisons de passage\u003C\u002Fi\u003E; we weren't supposed to live in them (we were supposed to be with host families in our posts), but we'd find ways to extend our stays. Each \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaison\u003C\u002Fi\u003E had a stash of books. You'd leave the ones you came with and take some before you left. Some \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaisons\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in far-off places had venerated, less picked-over collections.\n\nSo English it was, and whatever guilt I felt was no match for the allure of a good escape. Plus there's this: reading books was *better* for me there than it was before or has been since. I had enough time to become immersed in the stories and finish them without struggling to recall what was going on or having to reread chapters. But more than that, books just seemed more vivid somehow.\n\n**Descriptions of villages and animals roaming around**—yes, I know it.\n\n**Heartache, loneliness**—yes, I feel it.\n\n**Beauty, harshness, death**—yes, I see it.\n\nMy mind was primed by need or by exposure to otherworldliness to follow their lead. Stripped of most other distractions, I was vulnerable to their stories. Now, yes, I still read, but it hasn't been the same since. Maybe that's good—a sign of a healthier mental state—but it's also from having too little time and too many easy, stupid distractions. \n\nSo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n\nDecember 7, 2022\n\n* Read more books.\n",snippet:"Reading books in Mauritania was better than it was before or has been since.

I was in the midst of what might have been my hardest stretch in Mauritania. My first year teaching had just started. I hadn't yet figured out how to have any independence from my host family. I was sleep deprived from guests hanging out, loudly, until the middle of the night. It was Ramadan. Many volunteers were leaving the country, accepting the early termination offered in the wake of September 11.  All these things each deserve paragraphs of their own but for now let's just say my moods were all over the place. My second journal actually opens on November 18 with this admonishment to myself: \"avoid cataloging mood swings—your last journal is not very flattering.\"\n\nKinda harsh. That's the journal that went missing somehow—tragically, inexplicably—so I'll never know again just how bad it was.\n\nIt's clear, though, that I did not take my own advice. Within days the second journal ping-pongs from timid optimism to despair and back again in the four days between its first entry and Thanksgiving. It captures a thoughtful description of a graveyard along the path to school, a lukewarm description of my first class (\"It went pretty well\"), an angry rant about being kept up at night, and a near celebration after meeting and hanging out with two other teachers. One Pulaar and the other Wolof, they were Mauritanian but not from around Tintane. What I understood at the time was that new teachers would be sent to teach far away from their homes as some sort of anticorruption measure. True or not, they felt like outsiders and we connected on that basis.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n  ![Sleeping platform](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg)\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EWhere I slept during my first months in Tintane.

Walking into my compound felt like coming home. So far my outlook is good, but I don't want to speak too soon.

Why it didn't just stay in the latrine is something I didn't think to wonder about until now.\n\nHassaniya is an Arabic language brought to the region by the Beni Hassan tribe in the 15th century. It's spoken, not written. Mauritanians learn Standard Arabic in school, and many of them were amused that we would write Hassaniya down. That's how we learned: by listening and transcribing into our notebooks. It's to the Peace Corps' credit that they taught language in a way that really worked—intensely, immersed in the community, and with a real sense of priority of what needed to be taught first.\n\nOur language lessons were part of our community-based training. My cohort included education volunteers (of which I was one) and small-enterprise-development volunteers. We were in Boghé, along the Senegal river in the southwest of the country; our SED friends were in Kaédi, about 100 kilometers southeast. Each group would spend maybe ten days at a time with their host families and going to language lessons before all coming back to Boghé for days together at the training center outside of town.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![mosquito nets](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F6qU2YdjWh47InndA2BvlNe\u002Ffd2500368f3f4fcd61c2b9d913af4156\u002Fmosquito-nets.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003EMosquito nets set up around the foam mattresses I and fellow volunteers slept on at the training center in Boghé.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nMy host family during training spoke Hassaniya but was culturally more affiliated with Senegal. One of my host-sisters spoke French and was the only person I could communicate with much at all. Other than that, in the early days I was rendered completely incompetent by language and cultural differences. Unable to speak and still learning to eat properly, I felt a connection with the months-old infant of the family who spent time lying on her back mindlessly staring at the sky, much as I myself did.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![baby](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EThe baby with whom I shared comparable linguistic ability.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nWe got up to speed quickly, though. Language lessons were intense. There were two sessions a day, two or three hours in the morning and another two or three in the afternoon. In between it was too hot to do much except commune with the infants. My group had one teacher and four other volunteers. We would gather under a shade tree, notebooks in one hand and Nalgene bottles of treated well water in the other, and stumble through role plays and monologues, practicing greetings (which were varied and could seem endless), descriptions of our families back home, and explanations of why we were in Mauritania in the first place. Numbers, days of the week, months; transportation and how to ask for help; illnesses, thirst, and hunger. While a child's brain is like a sponge for soaking up languages, mine at 23 felt like a dishrag being twisted dry at the end of every day. It was getting the job done but not without some pain. I came, in time, to like that feeling, complete mental exhaustion offset somewhat by the buzz of learning so much. Only language learning feels like that.\n\nIn the end, my Hassaniya was okay. I could speak better than I could understand, and so I spent a large part of my two years mildly confused at all times. The truly proficient could wield idioms and proverbs at will, to the delight of their Mauritanian friends. I could never keep them straight for some reason, even though they were rich and colorful. There were stories about hyenas and bandits and voyages and vagabonds, and while it may be true that drop by drop the wadi fills with water, it was at times too much for my mind to hold.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Notebook page](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\n  A page from the beginning of my Hassaniya notebook, dated June 13, 2001.

That meant having other Peace Corps Volunteers nearby and an internet cafe. It meant more dependable water and even a restaurant or two. It meant a handful of French and German expats to hang out with. And it meant a better school (in some ways) and more understanding school administrators.\n\nMy assignment was to teach English to high-school students, and my primary qualification for the job was being a native speaker. We were trained, to be clear, but it was not and could not have been enough to prepare us for the task. In Tintane, I taught three classes of very likable kids who seemed to believe—rightly so, I think—that learning English wasn't going to do much for them. And they acted accordingly.

It’s spoken, not written. Mauritanians learn Standard Arabic in school, and many of them were amused that we would write Hassaniya down. That’s how we learned: by listening and transcribing into our notebooks. It’s to the Peace Corps’ credit that they taught language in a way that really worked—intensely, immersed in the community, and with a real sense of priority of what needed to be taught first.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur language lessons were part of our community-based training.

We would gather under a shade tree, notebooks in one hand and Nalgene bottles of treated well water in the other, and stumble through role plays and monologues, practicing greetings (which were varied and could seem endless), descriptions of our families back home, and explanations of why we were in Mauritania in the first place. Numbers, days of the week, months; transportation and how to ask for help; illnesses, thirst, and hunger. While a child’s brain is like a sponge for soaking up languages, mine at 23 felt like a dishrag being twisted dry at the end of every day. It was getting the job done but not without some pain.
