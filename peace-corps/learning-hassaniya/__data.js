Social media generally makes me less happy now; I can't imagine it would have improved my life back then.\n\nI kept in touch with family and friends back home mostly by writing letters and occasionally emailing and calling home when I traveled to bigger towns, where some corner stores had public pay phones. The connection was always bad and had a long delay, up to maybe two or three seconds—enough to make conversation difficult. The line clicked every few seconds, counting up the cost of the call in real time. Some piece of analog wizardry would display the total number of clicks at the end of the call. \n\nSometimes the delay was so bad we'd take to saying \"over\" at the end of every statement to avoid awkwardly talking over each other all the time.\n\n\"I'm in Kiffa and doing well, over.\"\n\n\"Are you healthy? Over.\"\n\n\"For the most part, yes. Over.\"\n\n\"Have a good trip home and be safe, over.\"\n\n\"I will. I love you. Over.\"\n\n____\n\nDespite taking some pleasure in being so disconnected, I was excited when cell phones swept across the country. I had just returned to Tintane from our Early-Term Reconnect (ETR—an in-service training) in Nouakchott when I heard the news:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nFebruary 4, 2002\n\nPhones are coming to Tintane. *Portables*, too. (So I hear.) Back home, I had no desire for a cell phone. Why? But here the prospect excited me. Contact with friends! I could know what's going on with the PC crew, and during the really hard times I could get in touch with someone.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nSeveral weeks later, I had one. It happened quickly. The towers went up, stores with phones and SIM cards appeared in the market, and soon it seemed like everyone had a cell phone. I got one pretty quickly, too. The Peace Corps paid for it since it was a basic safety advantage to be able to get in touch directly in case of emergency\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nMarch 12, 2002\n\nI've got a cell phone now, which is the strangest thing in these surroundings. It doesn't change things much—I can't afford to really talk to people very much, but for safety, making plans, and keeping in touch, it's nice.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nMy stipend wasn't enough to burn through minutes like crazy, and my Mauritanian neighbors for the most part didn't have money to keep their credits up either. At the time, you paid only for outgoing calls so people quickly learned to call and hang up in the hopes that the other person—the loser—would call back. \n\nHaving the cell phone did give some peace of mind, but I remember feeling this absurd disappointment when it didn't just start ringing out of blue, as if my friends and family should have magically known my phone number and rushed to get in touch. Its silence was more wrenching than its absence. I tried calling home on it a few times, but the connections were worse than the landline; eventually I used it only for domestic calls. \n\nHaving a phone and, later, easier access to email didn't replace writing letters. They served different purposes. Phone calls were too quick: useful for check-ins and for hearing someone's voice, but they couldn't match the deliberateness and thoroughness of writing. Now, though, twenty years later, taking the time to talk to someone on the phone seems like a quaint,  old-fashioned pursuit. And writing, sadly, seems absolutely aberrant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and abhorrent.\n",snippet:"It was during my Peace Corps service that mobile phones really spread through Mauritania.

We stopped for evening prayers and to have some tea on the side of the route. Night fell as we got back in and the landscape took on a peaceful monochromatic glow. A long lingering twilight silhouetted gentle waves of dunes. We floated on tires deflated for travel in sand. The moon eventually rose and cast everything in soft, shallow relief, underexposed and underdeveloped. As I fell in and out of sleep, whether from tiredness or carbon monoxide I do not know, the rickety 4x4 I was in transformed into a sleigh and the sand to snow. The smell of woodsmoke from cooking fires gave me visions instead of chimneys and cold nights back home. I thought of storybook winter villages. I thought of Christmas.\n\nMy winter dreamstate dissolved when we stopped. Kankosso was dark. It had no electricity, and that was in fact part of what I was excited about. In Tintane, electricity helped me read at night but otherwise made life more frustrating. My host family—my food family really—had satellite TV and watched it constantly. Who can blame them? It was a luxury and neighbors would come over to watch, but for me it was a maddening waste of time. I couldn't understand it and it engrossed my companions so completely that all conversation was stifled. Al Jazeera news, weird soap operas about the crusades, and me trying to ignore it all to focus on reading or my vocabulary flash cards.\n\nIn Kankossa, the quiet was welcome. By day there was lake Kankossa  bordered abruptly by tall sand dunes. There were gardens and date groves along the water. The people were kind. By night, the sky was dark behind the Milky Way. We read by lantern light. The walls of the group house in Kankossa had graffiti from decades of Peace Corp volunteers who'd passed through before, leaving messages for their successors. It felt historical and magical.\n\nThe contrast with Tintane was stark. I'd been forming a theory about it: too big to be a village and too small to be a town, Tintane had the benefits of neither. Kankossa had the charm of a small village. I wrote about it after returning to Tintane:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\nDecember 29, 2001\n\nI've just returned from an extended trip to Kiffa and Kankossa. It was good. I fell in love with Kankossa: small, quiet, pretty, nice people. What more is needed?\n\nI had a lot of time to think about what had been bothering me and I think I've found some motivation to turn things around. Yes, I think Tintane is a hard site, with obstacles somehow that other sites may not have, but I will try to make the best of it. I'm sure I'll write more on it later. Now, I'm off to the market to avoid being in my room.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nThe sense of optimism must have been my Christmas present that year. Like a child, I played with it for a day or two and then grew tired of it. A couple days later and I found myself exactly where I was before, venting to myself in my journals about the same old frustrations. But one realization did stick with me: I did have an especially hard site. It was a slow realization that crystallized the more I visited other volunteers throughout Mauritania. While the frustrations didn't really lessen much until I left Tintane for Aioun, at least I was beginning to blame myself less for them.\n\nAnd that truly was a gift.\n",snippet:"The contrast with Tintane was stark.

I knew it at the time, and my journal is full of little snippets of advice to myself, micro resolutions that I rarely adhered to. Like this:\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\nDecember 11, 2001\n\n* You will never learn a language if you don't seek out people to speak with.\n* Staying in your room so much can do nothing but harm.\n* Stop avoiding people.\n* Stop listening to the radio so much, especially in English. If noise is necessary, find French.\n* Find some French books to read.\n* Always question your first reaction.\n\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\nReading was indeed a pleasure, and it was sort of a guilty one. It was solitary when I was supposed to be out talking to people and doing crosscultural things. I felt guilty about immersing myself in English after investing so much time and effort to learn another language. Sometimes I did try reading books in French instead but I couldn't do so without looking up dozens of words per page. And that damn \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Epassé simple\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, right? Never worked out.\n\nDespite that guilt, I read a lot of books in Mauritania. I had a lot of downtime, and books provided a needed escape from everyday difficulties. Besides, there weren't many other sources of easy entertainment. I would tune my shortwave radio to the BBC World Service for maybe  an hour a day but otherwise entertainment was either listening to one of the handful of cassette tapes I brought with me or reading. And reading won out, probably for hours a day. Strangely, though, I don't remember many of them. The \u003Ccite\u003EGrapes of Wrath\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E, \u003Ccite\u003ECaptain Corelli's Mandolin\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E, \u003Ccite\u003ECold Mountain\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E. Three come to mind? There were scores more, and I wish I could remember them all.\n\nHundreds of mostly paperbacks floated around among volunteers and lined bookshelves throughout the country. In Nouakchott, the capital, we had, until the very end of my service, a house where all volunteers would stay when they were in town. Most regional capitals had one too, and in some other towns volunteers would pool money for a shared space. They were called \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaisons de passage\u003C\u002Fi\u003E; we weren't supposed to live in them (we were supposed to be with host families in our posts), but we'd find ways to extend our stays. Each \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaison\u003C\u002Fi\u003E had a stash of books. You'd leave the ones you came with and take some before you left. Some \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaisons\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in far-off places had venerated, less picked-over collections.\n\nSo English it was, and whatever guilt I felt was no match for the allure of a good escape. Plus there's this: reading books was *better* for me there than it was before or has been since. I had enough time to become immersed in the stories and finish them without struggling to recall what was going on or having to reread chapters. But more than that, books just seemed more vivid somehow.\n\n**Descriptions of villages and animals roaming around**—yes, I know it.\n\n**Heartache, loneliness**—yes, I feel it.\n\n**Beauty, harshness, death**—yes, I see it.\n\nMy mind was primed by need or by exposure to otherworldliness to follow their lead. Stripped of most other distractions, I was vulnerable to their stories. Now, yes, I still read, but it hasn't been the same since.

I was in the midst of what might have been my hardest stretch in Mauritania. My first year teaching had just started. I hadn't yet figured out how to have any independence from my host family. I was sleep deprived from guests hanging out, loudly, until the middle of the night. It was Ramadan. Many volunteers were leaving the country, accepting the early termination offered in the wake of September 11.  All these things each deserve paragraphs of their own but for now let's just say my moods were all over the place. My second journal actually opens on November 18 with this admonishment to myself: \"avoid cataloging mood swings—your last journal is not very flattering.\"\n\nKinda harsh. That's the journal that went missing somehow—tragically, inexplicably—so I'll never know again just how bad it was.\n\nIt's clear, though, that I did not take my own advice. Within days the second journal ping-pongs from timid optimism to despair and back again in the four days between its first entry and Thanksgiving. It captures a thoughtful description of a graveyard along the path to school, a lukewarm description of my first class (\"It went pretty well\"), an angry rant about being kept up at night, and a near celebration after meeting and hanging out with two other teachers. One Pulaar and the other Wolof, they were Mauritanian but not from around Tintane. What I understood at the time was that new teachers would be sent to teach far away from their homes as some sort of anticorruption measure. True or not, they felt like outsiders and we connected on that basis.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n  ![Sleeping platform](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5b4QLBl7fDeDECn1Dmhka9\u002F679b62e7c9ca83a7c551bae279af65c2\u002Fsleeping-platform.jpg)\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EWhere I slept during my first months in Tintane.

A___ offered to take my class the next day, which gave me time to travel to Aioun for Thanksgiving.

Walking into my compound felt like coming home. So far my outlook is good, but I don't want to speak too soon.

Why it didn't just stay in the latrine is something I didn't think to wonder about until now.\n\nHassaniya is an Arabic language brought to the region by the Beni Hassan tribe in the 15th century. It's spoken, not written. Mauritanians learn Standard Arabic in school, and many of them were amused that we would write Hassaniya down. That's how we learned: by listening and transcribing into our notebooks. It's to the Peace Corps' credit that they taught language in a way that really worked—intensely, immersed in the community, and with a real sense of priority of what needed to be taught first.\n\nOur language lessons were part of our community-based training. My cohort included education volunteers (of which I was one) and small-enterprise-development volunteers. We were in Boghé, along the Senegal river in the southwest of the country; our SED friends were in Kaédi, about 100 kilometers southeast.

One of my host-sisters spoke French and was the only person I could communicate with much at all. Other than that, in the early days I was rendered completely incompetent by language and cultural differences. Unable to speak and still learning to eat properly, I felt a connection with the months-old infant of the family who spent time lying on her back mindlessly staring at the sky, much as I myself did.\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\n![baby](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EThe baby with whom I shared comparable linguistic ability.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nWe got up to speed quickly, though. Language lessons were intense. There were two sessions a day, two or three hours in the morning and another two or three in the afternoon. In between it was too hot to do much except commune with the infants. My group had one teacher and four other volunteers. We would gather under a shade tree, notebooks in one hand and Nalgene bottles of treated well water in the other, and stumble through role plays and monologues, practicing greetings (which were varied and could seem endless), descriptions of our families back home, and explanations of why we were in Mauritania in the first place. Numbers, days of the week, months; transportation and how to ask for help; illnesses, thirst, and hunger. While a child's brain is like a sponge for soaking up languages, mine at 23 felt like a dishrag being twisted dry at the end of every day. It was getting the job done but not without some pain. I came, in time, to like that feeling, complete mental exhaustion offset somewhat by the buzz of learning so much. Only language learning feels like that.\n\nIn the end, my Hassaniya was okay. I could speak better than I could understand, and so I spent a large part of my two years mildly confused at all times. The truly proficient could wield idioms and proverbs at will, to the delight of their Mauritanian friends. I could never keep them straight for some reason, even though they were rich and colorful. There were stories about hyenas and bandits and voyages and vagabonds, and while it may be true that drop by drop the wadi fills with water, it was at times too much for my mind to hold.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Notebook page](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\n  A page from the beginning of my Hassaniya notebook, dated June 13, 2001.

But things were on an upward trend, and I was looking forward to my second year. I had left my first town, Tintane, for the relative cosmopolitan allure of the regional capital, Aioun. That meant having other Peace Corps Volunteers nearby and an internet cafe. It meant more dependable water and even a restaurant or two. It meant a handful of French and German expats to hang out with. And it meant a better school (in some ways) and more understanding school administrators.\n\nMy assignment was to teach English to high-school students, and my primary qualification for the job was being a native speaker. We were trained, to be clear, but it was not and could not have been enough to prepare us for the task. In Tintane, I taught three classes of very likable kids who seemed to believe—rightly so, I think—that learning English wasn't going to do much for them. And they acted accordingly. It was complete mayhem at times: Everyone out of their seats running around and making jokes. Rampant cheating on quizzes. Days when no one showed up.

The 5\u003Csup\u003Eemes\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E are apparently in their fourth year of English. That was a surprise.

Unable to speak and still learning to eat properly, I felt a connection with the months-old infant of the family who spent time lying on her back mindlessly staring at the sky, much as I myself did.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class=\"two-thirds\"\u003E\n\u003Cpicture\u003E\n        \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=avif&w=1480&h=1007&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=avif&w=740&h=504&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=avif&w=800&h=544&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=avif&w=400&h=272&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\"\u003E\u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=webp&w=1480&h=1007&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=webp&w=740&h=504&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=webp&w=800&h=544&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg?fm=webp&w=400&h=272&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\"\u003E\n        \u003Cimg load=\"lazy\" class=\"full\" src=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2fgxt1Auc2mw7eZ8fUa4q6\u002F1f5b0abadc61c2194c87d14821d3dfbd\u002Fbaby.jpg\" width=\"3492px\" height=\"2376px\" alt=\"A baby crawls on a cement platform in family compound.

Language lessons were intense. There were two sessions a day, two or three hours in the morning and another two or three in the afternoon. In between it was too hot to do much except commune with the infants. My group had one teacher and four other volunteers. We would gather under a shade tree, notebooks in one hand and Nalgene bottles of treated well water in the other, and stumble through role plays and monologues, practicing greetings (which were varied and could seem endless), descriptions of our families back home, and explanations of why we were in Mauritania in the first place. Numbers, days of the week, months; transportation and how to ask for help; illnesses, thirst, and hunger. While a child’s brain is like a sponge for soaking up languages, mine at 23 felt like a dishrag being twisted dry at the end of every day. It was getting the job done but not without some pain. I came, in time, to like that feeling, complete mental exhaustion offset somewhat by the buzz of learning so much. Only language learning feels like that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, my Hassaniya was okay. I could speak better than I could understand, and so I spent a large part of my two years mildly confused at all times. The truly proficient could wield idioms and proverbs at will, to the delight of their Mauritanian friends. I could never keep them straight for some reason, even though they were rich and colorful. There were stories about hyenas and bandits and voyages and vagabonds, and while it may be true that drop by drop the wadi fills with water, it was at times too much for my mind to hold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\u003Cpicture\u003E\n        \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=avif&w=1480&h=2085&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=avif&w=740&h=1043&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=avif&w=800&h=1127&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=avif&w=400&h=564&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\"\u003E\u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=webp&w=1480&h=2085&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=webp&w=740&h=1043&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=webp&w=800&h=1127&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg?fm=webp&w=400&h=564&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\"\u003E\n        \u003Cimg load=\"lazy\" class=\"full\" src=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5Ps7k8Q6SgWHebdAjqSUGw\u002Ffd911940a0d2697b7014ae4634c77016\u002Fnotebook.jpg\" width=\"4664px\" height=\"6572px\" alt=\"Hand written notes in blue ink on watermarked and faded notebook paper.\" \u002F\u003E\n    \u003C\u002Fpicture\u003E\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\n  A page from the beginning of my Hassaniya notebook, dated June 13, 2001.
