We’d been preparing mentally to be evacuated ever since September 11. In the weeks just after the attacks, when we were all huddled together at the \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaison\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in Nouakchott, a fellow volunteer known for histrionics (you know who you are! lol) burst into a room where we were playing mafia or some such thing and said, “I just heard from the bureau! The US has bombed Damascus and we’ve been ordered to evacuate. Time to pack your bags!”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe all believed him. That was exactly how it was going to happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEighteen months later, it did happen, only it wasn’t Damascus getting bombed but Baghdad. In the end we weren’t evacuated, but I believe we came close. Things certainly got a little wild.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe all thought we’d be sent home once the war started, and we’d been waiting for it for a long time. The BBC World Service reported each fractional step closer to war for months. That was my early-21st-century version of doom scrolling: breaking out my shortwave radio every hour on the hour to take part in the slow build toward catastrophe. While we expected protests borne of Arab solidarity and latent anti-Americanism, the only aggression I witnessed was an old lady cursing me and spitting at my feet. Was that because of Iraq? Hard to know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, on March 18 armed local police started guarding our homes in Aioun. The next day, when the bombing began, the police started following us around town, which made visiting people or going to the market a little awkward. It didn’t last long. The head of police for the region or town decided to consolidate all the foreigners together. The Germans all went to a German expat’s place; the French and Americans all went to a French expat’s. Believe me, there were worse places to be. We already knew his place very well. We’d gather there for dinner parties, to swim in his pool, to drink and smoke cigarettes, and to watch TV. It was a decadent, epicurean oasis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe were in our decadent house arrest for nearly a week when things got weird and uncanny. At first, it was just us four Peace Corps volunteers and one of the French volunteers, enjoying the hospitality of our gracious host. Then another French volunteer showed up. Then a French guy on a motorcycle showed up. Then two Swedish tourists showed up. Basically, any non-German foreigner passing through Aioun—usually a rare event!—was put under house arrest with us. We nine uninvited houseguests lived together for a few days, vying for sleeping space, sharing wine, hoping to wait out the threat so that we could go our various ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur momentary life of luxury wasn’t exactly without care. In general, I was ready to go. I’d basically completed my service. But specifically, there were a lot of things I hadn’t done. I didn’t have many souvenirs; I had no pictures of my students; I had had no closure with anyone I would have wanted closure with. Despite the pool and the booze and other comforts of my enclosure, it was stressful to see my service potentially end with such a whimper. Plus one of the French guys came down with malaria, left to go to the hospital, and came back later, IV bag in tow, to sleep off his fever for a few days. Fun times.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter four days the Wali decided that the Americans should go to Nouakchott. He called the bureau to ask them to get us out of Aioun, and they agreed to either charter a plane or have us get on the next commercial flight to the capital. For some reason the plane never showed up, and it was a few days later before a Peace Corp vehicle arrived with its logos long ago removed. We were to leave town at 4:30 the next morning to avoid trouble.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy memory of what happened next is dim. My journal skips 10 days. My next entry is a largely illegible poem about doubt, confusion, and frustration rising from a romantic pursuit, which means that we volunteers were together again in Nouakchott. A few days later the option was out: for the second time during my service (the first was after September 11) any volunteer who wanted to leave Mauritania (early terminate) could do so without repercussion and perhaps continue their service elsewhere. At that point I only had less than two months to go, so I stayed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI returned to Aioun around April 22. Protests and threats in response to the invasion of Iraq never amounted to much. It was good to be back, to get back to my routine and to teaching, and to trying to do Peace Corps in a time of war. I don’t know what my students did while I was gone, whether a fellow teacher covered for me or if the kids just had some extra free time, but there was some extra writing on the wall, caricatures of George Bush and graffiti calling him a dog. I didn’t disagree but I pretended not to notice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\u003Cpicture\u003E\n        \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=avif&w=1480&h=982&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=avif&w=740&h=491&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=avif&w=800&h=531&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=avif&w=400&h=265&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Favif\"\u003E\u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=webp&w=1480&h=982&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=webp&w=740&h=491&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\" media=\"(min-width:632px)\"\u003E\n                          \u003Csource srcset=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=webp&w=800&h=531&q=30 2x, \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg?fm=webp&w=400&h=265&q=30 1x\" type=\"image\u002Fwebp\"\u003E\n        \u003Cimg load=\"lazy\" class=\"full\" src=\"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg\" width=\"3537px\" height=\"2346px\" alt=\"Black and white image of classroom walls with graffiti.
