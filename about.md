I am a freelance consultant helping policy and advocacy organizations gain influence and drive engagement with innovative reports, web- and mobile-first publications, data visualization, smart analytics, and clear language. 

As the director of digital communications at the [Center for Global Development](http://www.cgdev.org/), I oversaw the communication teamâ€™s work on publications, multimedia, and online engagement and worked with vendors and freelancers on the editing, design, layout, and production of CGD's print and interactive products.

I carved out the time for several productive side projects, including an AngularJS web app for interactive reports ([example](http://www.cgdev.org/app/reader/3124016)), a Highcharts platform for branded and shareable data visualizations ([example](http://www.cgdev.org/media/income-categories-and-proposed-energy-categories)), and similar work for making static data tables interactive, using the Datatable.js platform ([example](http://www.cgdev.org/media/opic-scraped-portfolio-dataset)).
