I am a freelance consultant helping policy and advocacy organizations gain influence and drive engagement with innovative reports, web- and mobile-first publications, data visualization, smart analytics, and clear language. 

As the director of digital communications at the [Center for Global Development](http://www.cgdev.org/), I oversaw the communication teamâ€™s work on publications, multimedia, and online engagement and worked with vendors and freelancers on the editing, design, layout, and production of CGD's print and interactive products.

My experience includes communications strategy writ large, including crafting messages, identifying targets, and setting SMART goals; project management on a daily or longer basis, with proficiency on Asana, Trello, Basecamp, and other tools; design with Adobe InDesign and Illustrator; and hands-on coding with JavaScript (plain-vanilla, JQuery, Backbone, Angular, Chart.js, Highcharts.js), HTML, and CSS.
