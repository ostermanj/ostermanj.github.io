I am a freelance consultant helping organizations communicate effectively with digital-first publications, data visualization, smart analytics, and clear language. I'm currently working full-time at the [Pew Charitable Trusts](https://www.pewtrusts.org).

Much of my latest work has involved data dashboards, data explorers, and interactive charts. I use a mix of D3 and Highcharts, depending on project needs, for data visualization and mix of vanilla JavaScript and libraries for the code. Lately I've been using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> for creating very lightweight, high-performance apps that load quickly and are easy to maintain.

Before coding for a living, I was more of a communications generalist with experience leading comms teams and devising digital strategy writ large. That experience influences my work now, such that I am focused not only on good code but on good products, measurable outcomes, and effective communications. My sweet spot is distilling policy-oriented writing into engaging digital-first content.

**Skills:** 

- JavaScript (ES6+, D3, Mapbox GL JS, Webpack, Svelte, Highcharts.js), HTML, CSS, and PHP
- Drupal, Wordpress
- UI/UX prototyping
- project management, Asana, Trello, Basecamp, and other tools
- communications strategy, messaging, identifying targets, and setting SMART goals
- writing, substantive editing, and copy editing (Chicago Manual of Style)
