I am a freelance consultant helping organizations gain influence and drive engagement with innovative reports, web- and mobile-first publications, data visualization, smart analytics, and clear language. 

As the director of digital communications at the [Center for Global Development](http://www.cgdev.org/), I oversaw the communication teamâ€™s work on publications, multimedia, and online engagement and worked with vendors and freelancers on the editing, design, layout, and production of CGD's print and interactive products. Before that I was working on my Masters in anthropology; before that I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Mauritania.

**Skills:** 

- communications strategy, messaging, identifying targets, and setting SMART goals
- editing research and marketing documents (especially to Chicago Manual of Style standards)
- publication production and design 
- project management, with proficiency in Asana, Trello, Basecamp, and other tools
- coding in JavaScript (plain-vanilla, D3, JQuery, Backbone, Angular, Chart.js, Highcharts.js), HTML, CSS, and some PHP

I'm most familar with Drupal and WordPress content management systems.
