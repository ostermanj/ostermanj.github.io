I am a web developer specializing in data visualization and special web projects for the [Pew Charitable Trusts](https://www.pewtrusts.org). I am occasionally available for side projects.

My latest projects have been map-based data dashboards, data explorers, interactive charts, and immersive storytelling features. 

Before coding for a living, I was a communications generalist with experience leading comms teams and devising digital strategy writ large. That experience influences my work now, such that I am focused not only on good code but on good products, measurable outcomes, and effective communications. My sweet spot is distilling policy-oriented writing into engaging digital-first content.

**Skills:** 

- JavaScript (ES6+, D3, Mapbox GL JS, Webpack, Svelte, Highcharts.js), HTML, CSS, and PHP
- Drupal, Wordpress, Sitecore
- AWS and MS Azure serverless functions, databases, and user authentication
- UI/UX prototyping
- writing and editing
