The new method is better. It allows you to bring private variables (secrets such as API keys) into server-side code without workarounds. Public variables can be imported into client-side code.\n\n\u003Caside class=\"notice\"\u003EAll things SvelteKit are moving very fast and breaking changes are introduced frequently as it moves toward a stable version 1.0 release. Be sure to check out the date this post was published‚Äîit may get old fast.\u003C\u002Faside\u003E\n\n## How\n\nFour SvelteKit modules are at play to make this happen:\n\n1. [`$env\u002Fdynamic\u002Fpublic`][2]\n2. [`$env\u002Fdynamic\u002Fprivate`][3]\n3. [`$env\u002Fstatic\u002Fpublic`][4]\n4. [`$env\u002Fstatic\u002Fprivate`][5]\n\nThe `dynamic` modules are for variables accessed at runtime‚Äîvariables not necessarily known at build time. The `static` modules for variables that can be injected as strings at build time. The `public` modules expose variables that are prefixed by \"PUBLIC_\" or another prefix set in your config file. The `private` modules expose variables not prefixed; trying to import them into client-side code will throw an error. That's to keep you from accidentally exposing secrets to the front end. See the docs for more information.\n\nIn your DEV environment you can supply your public and private variables in a `.env` file. That file shouldn't be committed to source control, especially if it has private variables. In a STAGE or PROD environment you'll want to supply your environment variables through `process.env` by setting variables or secrets directly with your deployment service such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, Azure Static Web Apps, or whatever yours is. This site, for instance, is hosted by GitHub Pages; its secrets are saved as repository secrets through the GitHub UI.\n\nThe docs show how to import the variables. For dynamic variables, you import `env` as a named export of the `$env\u002Fdynamic\u002F*` module: `import { dev } from '$env\u002Fdynamic\u002Fpublic';`, for instance. Your variables are properties of the `env` object.\n\nStatic variables are imported directly as named exports from the `$env\u002Fstatic\u002F*` module. This site, for instance, fetches content from [Contentful](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.contentful.com\u002F) during its build process. That requires API keys and other secrets and looks like this:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Faaeb966d4de44eb2a0d9e96c27987ce5\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Faaeb966d4de44eb2a0d9e96c27987ce5\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\n## The (relatively) old way\n\nThe method outlined above came into being in July 2022, according to [SvelteKit's changelog](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsveltejs\u002Fkit\u002Fblob\u002Fmaster\u002Fpackages\u002Fkit\u002FCHANGELOG.md#100-next395). Before that, as best I understand, in  local development SvelteKit was exposing variables loaded by Vite from `.env`, but only variables prefixed with \"VITE_\". There was no straightforward way to import secrets into server-side code. One solution was to install [env-cmd](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npmjs.com\u002Fpackage\u002Fenv-cmd) and add `env-cmd` to the dev script in `package.json`. That would expose the variables in `.env` to your source code but would make a detour around SvelteKit's failsafe to prevent exposing secrets to the client.\n\n[1]: https:\u002F\u002Fkit.svelte.dev\u002F\n[2]: https:\u002F\u002Fkit.svelte.dev\u002Fdocs\u002Fmodules#$env-dynamic-public\n[3]: https:\u002F\u002Fkit.svelte.dev\u002Fdocs\u002Fmodules#$env-dynamic-private\n[4]: https:\u002F\u002Fkit.svelte.dev\u002Fdocs\u002Fmodules#$env-static-public\n[5]: https:\u002F\u002Fkit.svelte.dev\u002Fdocs\u002Fmodules#$env-static-private",snippet:"SvelteKit has a new way to bring environment variables into your code.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"3Zs1xPdBxUe7FNXmkXO59N"}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"5UDGtnFPGejPUdY4ZV8tSH"}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"qU1uNTaV2rrFJaT8Mha03",type:j,createdAt:s,updatedAt:s,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"SvelteKit logo and text",description:k,file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002FqU1uNTaV2rrFJaT8Mha03\u002F28f103dc12c4c15ec79f0e076a992997\u002Fp3nn57r52krvpdieblta.png",details:{size:35878,image:{width:1920,height:1080}},fileName:"p3nn57r52krvpdieblta.png",contentType:l}}},slug:"how-to-use-environment-variables-in-sveltekit-process-env"}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"5nT7UZh2gDjGmdQ8D9Pa7K",type:b,createdAt:t,updatedAt:t,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:"project"}},locale:g},fields:{title:"Chart building web app",workplace:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:u}},datePublished:"2021-03-07",body:"\nThis is a web app for people with no coding experience to build interactive charts for the web.

One persistent challenge in publishing for the web‚Äîa theme central to my work for more than ten years now‚Äîis that orgs are also publishing for print (or at least for PDF). That means that each asset, like a chart, actually needs several: one for print and potentially multiple for the web, for different screen sizes and resolutions. That usually means a lot of time sunk keeping versions in sync with one another.\n\n![user interface of the chart building tool with a menu down the left side and thumbnail images of charts](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F4MW9BiXIVLUSVHXKDPkaSv\u002Fde592f65984f15cec8d37b5a2372afd8\u002Fchartbuilder.png)\n\nThis tool solves that problem for charts.

One of those things is trying to access the entirety of a dataset that's behind map features that have not fully rendered. I'll explain what I mean about that in a moment; one of the solutions I've found, to cut to the chase, is to preprocess the data I need and attach it to a dummy feature that I know will render when the map loads.\n\n![mapbox dummy area](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F7BVY3VwnWJTM90HvIZbgqG\u002Fcbf88c45ce1baae670b4133954c2212c\u002Fmapbox-dummy-feature.png)\n\n## Some explanation\nThere are basically two ways to supply the data you are visualizing to Mapbox: 1) you can do it when your code is executed by supplying the Map instance's `addSource()` method with geoJSON data, whether literally (i.e., passing the geoJSON object directly), by reference, or by supplying a url to it or 2) you can supply the data beforehand, behind the scenes, by uploading data to Mapbox Studio or using its tiling service. When you supply the data beforehand, Mapbox converts it into a tileset, a collection of data ready to be loaded into a map at a range of zoom levels. When you `addSource()` to the map, you point instead to the ready-made tileset. (You can also upload the data to Mapbox Studio as a dataset, which you can later convert to tilesets.)\n\nI prefer to upload or tile-service the data beforehand rather than handle potentially very large geoJSON objects client-side and expend the resources and milliseconds (or seconds) needed to convert that data into tiles on every page load, every time someone visits the page. If the data is static, why task each client with performing those operations over and over again?\n\n## The problem\nIf you're only rendering features on a map and only displaying or inspecting or otherwise making use of the data properties of those features after they are rendered‚Äîfor example, by clicking or hovering over locations‚Äîthe above method of not handling the data client-side will be fine. But if you would like to also display data beyond the context of the map, such as summary stats or graphs in a sidebar, you will likely find that you don't have access to all the data points in the tileset because not all of the features have been rendered. Features may be outside the current bounds of the map, or they may be too densely packed to show at your current zoom level. So if you wanted to, for example, display a bar chart showing the number of the various kinds of, say, donut shops in your city, you would not reliably be able to get the full dataset using the [`queryRenderedFeatures()`](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.mapbox.com\u002Fmapbox-gl-js\u002Fapi\u002Fmap\u002F#map#queryrenderedfeatures) method. \n\n## One harder solution\nThere is a viable way to use the [`querySourceFeatures()`](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.mapbox.com\u002Fmapbox-gl-js\u002Fapi\u002Fmap\u002F#map#queryrenderedfeatures) method, which returns source data regardless of whether it has been rendered, but you have to manage two difficulties: data behind tiles outside the bounds of your current map viewport will not be returned and the same data may be returned more than once if the feature it's attached to spans multiple tiles.\n\nI've managed that solution for a project [mapping flood insurance programs](\u002Fcontent\u002Fmapping-data-from-the-national-flood-insurance-program\u002F) where the sidebar graphs were meant to update to always include only data for features within the current maps bounds. If your graphs don't need to adjust according to the map bounds, there are easier ways.\n\n## Easier solutions\nOne solution is to provide the full dataset to Mapbox for rendering features on the map and keep the same dataset client-side for other purposes. That doesn't sit well‚Äîyou've got two sources of truth and are using up system resources unnecessarily. Another option is to keep only a preprocessed summary of the data client-side. That's fine; I've done it this way and probably will again. The heavy work of manipulating the data is done once during a build or prebuild step, so at least you're sparing the client from doing the same, repetitive data manipulation over and over again. That still gives you two sources of truth, though, and a somewhat more complex thing to maintain or update.\n\nTo keep all the data‚Äîthe summary and its source‚Äîtogether, you can attach the summary data to a dummy feature in the tileset. A tileset of polygons scattered throughout a geographical area, for instance, could have a dummy polygon, the size of your map bounds, with the summary data attached to it as the feature's properties. Adjust its opacity to zero using a data-driven expression and there you have it. Whenever you have to update the data, you have it all in one source.\n\nIf your tileset is of points, you'll have to put the summary data in its own polygon tileset so that it can cover an area large enough to ensure that it is rendered on map load. That's not as clean but at least with everything coming as a tileset you won't be juggling multiple ways of serving up the data. Grab it with `queryRenderedFeatures()`, and you're good to go.\n\nThanks as always for reading.

I like that their documentation is thorough (though not always easy to digest). I like that they seem to have invested a lot of effort into making it a useful dataviz tool, in addition to all its other uses: navigation, geocoding, augmented vision. I like that they're headquartered here in DC. And I like that their pricing plans have a meaningful and useful free tier.\n\nAwesome.\n\nOver the three or four years I've been using it, though, I have come up against the same challenges. One is the difficulty of its expressions syntax for data-driven styling or interpolated values, which I have to look up every time. Another is accessing the full data behind map features that may not be fully rendered. Another‚Äîthe topic of this post‚Äîis how to work with the async nature of adding sources and layers to a map.\n\n![a mapbox view of San Diego with red, orange, and purple extruded recangles representing buildings on a dark background][2]\n\nAdding sources and layers to a Mapbox map is pretty straightforward. The source is the data, and the layer is a visualization of the data. You can have multiple layers based on the same data. To [add a source][3], you use the `addSource()` method of the Map instance. It takes an `id` string and a config object as parameters. The underlying data can be geoJSON, or a vector source already uploaded to Mapbox, or others like raster images or video. To [add a layer][4], you use the `addLayer()` method, which takes a config object and, optionally, the name of another layer to insert the new layer before.\n\nThe trouble is your code may quite easily call the `addLayer()` method\nbefore `addSource()` really takes effect. Both methods are quietly asynchronous, handled by Mapbox outside the written sequence of your code. Mapbox could, perhaps should, make those methods explicitly async or, in other words, make them Promises that resolve only after they have taken full effect. In fact, in this [Github issue][5], it looks like that may be in the works.\n\nIn the meantime, it simply takes time for `addSource()` and `addLayer()` to take effect, which means you have to ensure the map layers are ready before you try to do anything with them. My solution has been to wrap the native methods in my own Promises that test whether the layers are rendered before resolving. This way, I can add a source, add some layers, and then chain my next actions via `then()`.\n\nThat solution is available as a small npm package, [mapbox-helper][6]. Give it a try. More info about how it works and how to use it is available there. The short version is this: the native `addSource()` and `addLayer()` methods are combined into one, `addSourceAndLayers()`, in which you specify the source you want to add and one or more layers that are based on it. Internally, adding the layers only occurs after the source is ready. The method returns a Promise to your code that resolves only after all layers have been rendered or, if a layer's visibility property is set to 'none', is ready to be rendered.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fc8302e49e9b83b83a05bd2e964d92fba\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fc8302e49e9b83b83a05bd2e964d92fba\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nThanks for reading. And, by the way, if you haven't checked out Mapbox's [version 2 release yet][7], you should. It has really great 3D rendering of elevation data and super hi-res satellite imagery, among other performance improvements.\n\n[1]: https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.mapbox.com\u002Fmapbox-gl-js\u002Fapi\u002F\n[2]: \u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F3KfGz5kmTI4dkz0l98oHY3\u002F777fd2648aaab56363a79c818dc3d1c2\u002Fmapbox.png\n[3]: https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.mapbox.com\u002Fmapbox-gl-js\u002Fapi\u002Fsources\u002F\n[4]: https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.mapbox.com\u002Fmapbox-gl-js\u002Fapi\u002Fmap\u002F#map#addlayer\n[5]: https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fmapbox\u002Fmapbox-gl-js\u002Fissues\u002F10192\n[6]: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npmjs.com\u002Fpackage\u002Fmapbox-helper\n[7]: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mapbox.com\u002Fblog\u002Fmapbox-gl-js-v2-3d-maps-camera-api-sky-api-launch",snippet:"Use a small npm package to work with the async nature of adding sources and layers to a Mapbox map.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:x}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:q}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"3KfGz5kmTI4dkz0l98oHY3",type:j,createdAt:B,updatedAt:B,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"mapbox async layers",description:k,file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F3KfGz5kmTI4dkz0l98oHY3\u002F777fd2648aaab56363a79c818dc3d1c2\u002Fmapbox.png",details:{size:774983,image:{width:z,height:A}},fileName:"mapbox.png",contentType:l}}}}}],featuredWorkExperience:[{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"i4wC2707crrr3J7VA6sjf",type:b,createdAt:C,updatedAt:C,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:m}},locale:g},fields:{title:"Front-End Developer",workPlace:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"5oOuYjZ2En7UsYZddeN4xq"}},startDate:"2022-05-31",workPlaceName:"US Holocaust Memorial Museum",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ushmm.org"}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"5ipJqnKVDNDSxKnq3Q2Onc",type:b,createdAt:"2022-08-11T20:25:50.709Z",updatedAt:"2022-08-12T12:24:21.930Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:2,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:m}},locale:g},fields:{title:"Principal Associate (Web Developer)",workPlace:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:u}},startDate:"2018-08-01",endDate:"2022-05-20",workPlaceName:"The Pew Charitable Trusts",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pewtrusts.org"}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"6xrmlRLBZ2518GEx0Wu3Aq",type:b,createdAt:D,updatedAt:D,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:m}},locale:g},fields:{title:"Communications Specialist (part-time)",workPlace:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"2cuGeH3s2kAjIlVcvCwldo"}},startDate:"2017-12-01",endDate:"2018-08-17",workPlaceName:"Resources for the Future",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.rff.org"}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"1dc27YRSkI9JDeXZFRdp6q",type:b,createdAt:E,updatedAt:E,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:m}},locale:g},fields:{title:"Director of Digital Communications (and previous titles)",workPlace:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"3uOA1G8GrWndoQSTvgh7WN"}},startDate:"2008-04-01",endDate:"2016-04-15",workPlaceName:"Center for Global Development",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cgdev.org"}}]}},uses:{dependencies:n,params:n,parent:n,url:n}}]}}("Link","Entry","Space","3qr5d6sj491p","master","Environment","en-US","ContentType",1,"Asset","","image\u002Fpng","workPosition",void 0,"blogPost","6rhv4yMoAF3cN8jyYqZSWu","3AIjGHsEBIU2L5LSAhDYZG","data","2022-08-31T00:26:23.277Z","2022-08-16T17:11:11.708Z","3XICrBnljaJmlfz9SMgtb0","2022-08-16T17:10:23.298Z",10,"5tPE4sus2igTIK2zIdqyBz","2022-08-14T20:59:17.771Z",1014,716,"2022-08-14T21:09:00.907Z","2022-08-11T20:17:58.945Z","2022-08-11T20:32:23.102Z","2022-08-11T20:34:18.096Z"))
