That latter process involves running the raw data I receive from colleagues through some preprocessing Node scripts. With some of that output I manually update the part of the data embedded in Mapbox tiles; a future improvement would use Mapbox's tiling service to make those updates easier. Updating the documents is Elastic Search is done with Node scripts hitting the Elastic APIs. Updates have been smooth, though time consuming‚Äî there's room for more automation there. \n\nAs with any project that grows organically, one unforeseen piece at a time, the maintenance and design solutions have been challenging. But with some good decisions made at the outset, a complete refactor has not been necessary. Future improvements on the to-do list (or wishlist?) include more Typescript, full Dockerizing of the application, and more consolidation of the disparate parts.\n",snippet:"What began as a request for some data viz help from a former colleague turned into a full-fledged web app for multiple clients.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:s}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"5tPE4sus2igTIK2zIdqyBz"}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:n}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"5eqpISctWWBfj2p3syvcKh",type:j,createdAt:t,updatedAt:t,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"Multifamily dashboard",description:"Data visualization on dark background with yellows, oranges, and purples signifying values.

My colleagues on the research side secured a large handful of data sources, some public and some proprietary, to make it possible. They handed off to me mostly clean datasets for each indicator:\n\n* delinquency on bills\n* financial stability\n* balance on credit accounts\n* work locations\n* sales by sector\n* bankruptcy filings\n* jobs by sector\n* jobs by establishment size\n* hourly wages by sector\n\n## The back end and preprocessing\nI needed a database to store this data in. The datasets were too big to wrangle on the client side, and I had to keep potentially identifiable individual data points from being exposed to the front end. (For the same reason, the display of some data is redacted if the number of businesses making up the average falls below a threshold because of the filters applied.) The database could have been anything; I ended up using MS Azure Cosmos DB.\n\nAll the datasets are put into the dataset (created or updated) by API using some NodeJS scripts. The first three datasets, proprietary data from Experian, are sent to the database basically as-is with the addition of precalculated aggregates. When filters are applied, a serverless function queries the database for matching entries and recalculates the result on the fly. Other datasets have far fewer filters available; each filter option is precalculated before being added to the database.\n## The front end\nI built the front end with Svelte wrapped up by Webpack. There's some D3 in there. The build step prerenders the page so that the static dashboard appears immediately on page load. JavaScript then rehydrates the app and provides the interactivity‚Äîgood for core web vitals and SEO.\n",snippet:"This project to chart Philadelphia's economic recovery was one of my last while at Pew, and one of the hardest.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:s}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:n}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"17tItciHDEUKPnbdjjppF5",type:j,createdAt:u,updatedAt:u,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"Philly dashboard",description:"Data dashboard showing zip-code map and line graphs for three economic indicators: delinquency on bills, financial stability, and balance on credit accounts.",file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F17tItciHDEUKPnbdjjppF5\u002Ff4a3753ac81af209d954f5bd56f1ebd5\u002Fphilly-dashboard.png",details:{size:353232,image:{width:1500,height:1065}},fileName:"philly-dashboard.png",contentType:o}}}}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"27n0QDqqMFwDxstDwS8qJx",type:b,createdAt:"2023-01-13T01:49:32.802Z",updatedAt:"2023-02-22T21:22:31.999Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:13,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:"blogPost"}},locale:g},fields:{authors:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"6rhv4yMoAF3cN8jyYqZSWu"}}],title:"CSS container queries are here!",datePublished:"2023-01-12",dateUpdated:"2023-02-16",body:"\u003Caside class=\"update\"\u003E\n  Support for container queries landed in Firefox on February 13, 2023.\n\u003C\u002Faside\u003E\n\nIt's a good time to be a web developer. The excesses of client-side mania (mea culpa) are giving way to a rediscovery of server-side rendering (which of course never went anywhere). Build-and-deploy services like Vercel, Amplify, Azure Static Web Apps, and a host of others make it easy for small teams or one lone freelancer to set up fully featured websites with edge functions, caching, APIs, and smart image delivery. And with recent advances, especially in CSS, working on the [front of the front end](https:\u002F\u002Fbradfrost.com\u002Fblog\u002Fpost\u002Ffront-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development\u002F) is full of new possibilities and productivity gains.\n\nCSS, it turns out, [really is awesome](https:\u002F\u002Fduckduckgo.com\u002F?t=ffab&q=css+is+awesome&iax=images&ia=images).\n\n## Container queries, finally!\n\nOne of the features I and others have been most eagerly awaiting is container queries. They will make reusing responsive components in different contexts much easier. Grid and flexbox layouts have already lessened the need to use media queries to make layouts responsive to screen size. They are [*intrinsically* responsive](https:\u002F\u002Ftalks.jensimmons.com\u002F15TjNW), wrapping rows and columns based on container size without the need to instruct browsers at exactly what screen width to make the change.\n\nThat's great, but they haven't entirely eliminated my use of media queries. There is still a need to employ them to, for instance, hide an element within a grid at certain screen sizes. Here's a recent example from my work rebuilding the timeline-of-events pages for the [Holocaust Encyclopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fencyclopedia.ushmm.org\u002Fcontent\u002Fen\u002Ftimeline\u002Fholocaust).\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"fx fx-wrap ai-e\"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class=\"half\"\u003E\n\n![Timeline events without description shown](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5c3gZQDg7YwjqWwPNRZybi\u002F34d67b517736ba14d35a77aa1e242f43\u002FScreenshot_2023-01-11_at_8.56.40_AM.png)\n\n \u003Cfigcaption\u003EOn small screens less than 500px wide, no description is shown.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n    \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"half\"\u003E\n\n![Timeline event with description shown](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2zrWLBAT2ahMA0tLtIXEsu\u002F17eab9d573cec6fb7b263f5b092dab57\u002FScreenshot_2023-01-11_at_8.55.12_AM.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003EOn screens at least 500px wide, a media query ensures that the description is shown.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\nThis is the HTML for one of the content cards, each marked up as an `\u003Carticle\u003E`:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fb7b7b55bfb8483e4599dbf82f8690632\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fb7b7b55bfb8483e4599dbf82f8690632\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nThe CSS makes each event a flexbox with two flex-item children: the container for the image and the container for the text. The relative size of the two children is handled intrinsically using the `flex-grow` css property‚Äîno need for media queries there.\tBut we wanted to show the description of the event only on screens larger than 500px wide, and that required a media query:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F48a62a2cceebab82992e8fb8ce5b3703\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F48a62a2cceebab82992e8fb8ce5b3703\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nWhat that means, though, is that the list of events isn't 100% reusable in other contexts. Say I needed to put the list of events in a sidebar that was 320px wide? If the viewport were at least 500px wide, the event description would show even though the component would be much narrower than the threshold. The logic should be based on the size of the component, not the size of the screen. That's what container queries make possible.\n\n## Simple syntax\n\nThe syntax is pretty simple and builds what we already know from media queries. See the [MDN article](https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.mozilla.org\u002Fen-US\u002Fdocs\u002FWeb\u002FCSS\u002FCSS_Container_Queries) for a full description. \n\nChanging my example to use container queries would only require changing to CSS to declare a containment context on the `article` element, giving it a `container-type` and `container-name` using the `container` shorthand syntax:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fd948427303b301a896bf153b30c934f5\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fd948427303b301a896bf153b30c934f5\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nAnd then modify the media query from above to be a container query instead:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F1fca89adfbd045bb9a9e948b3b157293\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F1fca89adfbd045bb9a9e948b3b157293\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nPretty great! Now displaying or hiding the description depends on the size of the container rather than the viewport. That means the component can be used elsewhere without having to redefine at what screen sizes the description should appear. Code it once and use it everywhere.\n\n## Use them now?\n\nI'll be using container queries from here on out in personal projects soon, I hope, in work projects for production.\n\nContainer queries are landing in browsers and, at the time I'm writing this, have about 75% browser support globally. Firefox, notably, does not yet support them in the stable release but does in the nightly release. Coverage should be good enough now or very soon to use them in a progressive-enhancement sort of way, when you can accept that some browsers won't abide.\n\nThere is a [JavaScript polyfill](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FGoogleChromeLabs\u002Fcontainer-query-polyfill) available that simply works. Please read its docs before using.\n",snippet:"Container queries are coming, and they will make reusing responsive components in different contexts much easier.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"cNdrt61TxmpGdCVqJVNYj"}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"4THQ9OOeBdfmo5fzHu6mIr"}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"fMsWEAYYlWL7oGyXprIjF",type:j,createdAt:v,updatedAt:v,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"Containers",description:"A large stack of shipping containers on a ship or at harbor.",file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002FfMsWEAYYlWL7oGyXprIjF\u002Fe98ffee9cd68da2575ca39be60aae7cc\u002F15405674883_2c892ea4e2_b.jpg",details:{size:273916,image:{width:1024,height:682}},fileName:"15405674883_2c892ea4e2_b.jpg",contentType:"image\u002Fjpeg"}}},slug:"css-container-queries-are-here"}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"5nT7UZh2gDjGmdQ8D9Pa7K",type:b,createdAt:w,updatedAt:w,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:m}},locale:g},fields:{title:"Chart building web app",workplace:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:p}},datePublished:"2021-03-07",body:"\nThis is a web app for people with no coding experience to build interactive charts for the web.

One persistent challenge in publishing for the web‚Äîa theme central to my work for more than ten years now‚Äîis that orgs are also publishing for print (or at least for PDF). That means that each asset, like a chart, actually needs several: one for print and potentially multiple for the web, for different screen sizes and resolutions. That usually means a lot of time sunk keeping versions in sync with one another.\n\n![user interface of the chart building tool with a menu down the left side and thumbnail images of charts](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F4MW9BiXIVLUSVHXKDPkaSv\u002Fde592f65984f15cec8d37b5a2372afd8\u002Fchartbuilder.png)\n\nThis tool solves that problem for charts. The charts are digital-first, optimized for all screen sizes by virtue of Highcharts' responsiveness, but they can be exported as SVGs for use in print at whatever size the designers need. The print options are separated from the web version, but they all share the same source. Update one and you update the other. That translates to huge time savings.\n\nThere are off-the-shelf solutions not too different from this but none cross the print-web divide like this.\n\n**What else does it do?**\n\n* Users can log in through Google and save their work.
