That latter process involves running the raw data I receive from colleagues through some preprocessing Node scripts. With some of that output I manually update the part of the data embedded in Mapbox tiles; a future improvement would use Mapbox's tiling service to make those updates easier. Updating the documents in Elastic Search is done with Node scripts hitting the Elastic APIs. Updates have been smooth, though time consuming‚Äî there's room for more automation there. \n\nAs with any project that grows organically, one unforeseen piece at a time, the maintenance and design solutions have been challenging. But with some good decisions made at the outset, a complete refactor has not been necessary. Future improvements on the to-do list (or wishlist?) include more Typescript, full Dockerizing of the application, and more consolidation of the disparate parts.\n",snippet:"What began as a request for some data viz help from a former colleague turned into a full-fledged web app for multiple clients.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:s}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:"5tPE4sus2igTIK2zIdqyBz"}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:p}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"5eqpISctWWBfj2p3syvcKh",type:j,createdAt:t,updatedAt:t,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"Multifamily dashboard",description:"Data visualization on dark background with yellows, oranges, and purples signifying values.

My colleagues on the research side secured a large handful of data sources, some public and some proprietary, to make it possible. They handed off to me mostly clean datasets for each indicator:\n\n* delinquency on bills\n* financial stability\n* balance on credit accounts\n* work locations\n* sales by sector\n* bankruptcy filings\n* jobs by sector\n* jobs by establishment size\n* hourly wages by sector\n\n## The back end and preprocessing\nI needed a database to store this data in. The datasets were too big to wrangle on the client side, and I had to keep potentially identifiable individual data points from being exposed to the front end. (For the same reason, the display of some data is redacted if the number of businesses making up the average falls below a threshold because of the filters applied.) The database could have been anything; I ended up using MS Azure Cosmos DB.\n\nAll the datasets are put into the dataset (created or updated) by API using some NodeJS scripts. The first three datasets, proprietary data from Experian, are sent to the database basically as-is with the addition of precalculated aggregates. When filters are applied, a serverless function queries the database for matching entries and recalculates the result on the fly. Other datasets have far fewer filters available; each filter option is precalculated before being added to the database.\n## The front end\nI built the front end with Svelte wrapped up by Webpack. There's some D3 in there. The build step prerenders the page so that the static dashboard appears immediately on page load. JavaScript then rehydrates the app and provides the interactivity‚Äîgood for core web vitals and SEO.\n",snippet:"This project to chart Philadelphia's economic recovery was one of my last while at Pew, and one of the hardest.",tags:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:s}},{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:p}}],heroImage:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"17tItciHDEUKPnbdjjppF5",type:j,createdAt:v,updatedAt:v,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:i,locale:g},fields:{title:"Philly dashboard",description:"Data dashboard showing zip-code map and line graphs for three economic indicators: delinquency on bills, financial stability, and balance on credit accounts.",file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F17tItciHDEUKPnbdjjppF5\u002Ff4a3753ac81af209d954f5bd56f1ebd5\u002Fphilly-dashboard.png",details:{size:353232,image:{width:1500,height:1065}},fileName:"philly-dashboard.png",contentType:l}}}}},{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},id:"27n0QDqqMFwDxstDwS8qJx",type:b,createdAt:"2023-01-13T01:49:32.802Z",updatedAt:"2023-02-22T21:22:31.999Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:13,contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:"blogPost"}},locale:g},fields:{authors:[{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:w}}],title:"CSS container queries are here!",datePublished:"2023-01-12",dateUpdated:"2023-02-16",body:"\u003Caside class=\"update\"\u003E\n  Support for container queries landed in Firefox on February 13, 2023.\n\u003C\u002Faside\u003E\n\nIt's a good time to be a web developer. The excesses of client-side mania (mea culpa) are giving way to a rediscovery of server-side rendering (which of course never went anywhere). Build-and-deploy services like Vercel, Amplify, Azure Static Web Apps, and a host of others make it easy for small teams or one lone freelancer to set up fully featured websites with edge functions, caching, APIs, and smart image delivery. And with recent advances, especially in CSS, working on the [front of the front end](https:\u002F\u002Fbradfrost.com\u002Fblog\u002Fpost\u002Ffront-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development\u002F) is full of new possibilities and productivity gains.\n\nCSS, it turns out, [really is awesome](https:\u002F\u002Fduckduckgo.com\u002F?t=ffab&q=css+is+awesome&iax=images&ia=images).\n\n## Container queries, finally!\n\nOne of the features I and others have been most eagerly awaiting is container queries. They will make reusing responsive components in different contexts much easier. Grid and flexbox layouts have already lessened the need to use media queries to make layouts responsive to screen size. They are [*intrinsically* responsive](https:\u002F\u002Ftalks.jensimmons.com\u002F15TjNW), wrapping rows and columns based on container size without the need to instruct browsers at exactly what screen width to make the change.\n\nThat's great, but they haven't entirely eliminated my use of media queries. There is still a need to employ them to, for instance, hide an element within a grid at certain screen sizes. Here's a recent example from my work rebuilding the timeline-of-events pages for the [Holocaust Encyclopedia](https:\u002F\u002Fencyclopedia.ushmm.org\u002Fcontent\u002Fen\u002Ftimeline\u002Fholocaust).\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"fx fx-wrap ai-e\"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class=\"half\"\u003E\n\n![Timeline events without description shown](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F5c3gZQDg7YwjqWwPNRZybi\u002F34d67b517736ba14d35a77aa1e242f43\u002FScreenshot_2023-01-11_at_8.56.40_AM.png)\n\n \u003Cfigcaption\u003EOn small screens less than 500px wide, no description is shown.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n    \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"half\"\u003E\n\n![Timeline event with description shown](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F2zrWLBAT2ahMA0tLtIXEsu\u002F17eab9d573cec6fb7b263f5b092dab57\u002FScreenshot_2023-01-11_at_8.55.12_AM.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption\u003EOn screens at least 500px wide, a media query ensures that the description is shown.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\nThis is the HTML for one of the content cards, each marked up as an `\u003Carticle\u003E`:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fb7b7b55bfb8483e4599dbf82f8690632\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fb7b7b55bfb8483e4599dbf82f8690632\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nThe CSS makes each event a flexbox with two flex-item children: the container for the image and the container for the text. The relative size of the two children is handled intrinsically using the `flex-grow` css property‚Äîno need for media queries there.\tBut we wanted to show the description of the event only on screens larger than 500px wide, and that required a media query:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F48a62a2cceebab82992e8fb8ce5b3703\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F48a62a2cceebab82992e8fb8ce5b3703\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nWhat that means, though, is that the list of events isn't 100% reusable in other contexts. Say I needed to put the list of events in a sidebar that was 320px wide? If the viewport were at least 500px wide, the event description would show even though the component would be much narrower than the threshold. The logic should be based on the size of the component, not the size of the screen. That's what container queries make possible.\n\n## Simple syntax\n\nThe syntax is pretty simple and builds what we already know from media queries. See the [MDN article](https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.mozilla.org\u002Fen-US\u002Fdocs\u002FWeb\u002FCSS\u002FCSS_Container_Queries) for a full description. \n\nChanging my example to use container queries would only require changing to CSS to declare a containment context on the `article` element, giving it a `container-type` and `container-name` using the `container` shorthand syntax:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fd948427303b301a896bf153b30c934f5\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002Fd948427303b301a896bf153b30c934f5\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nAnd then modify the media query from above to be a container query instead:\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F1fca89adfbd045bb9a9e948b3b157293\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003EEmbedded content: https:\u002F\u002Fgist.github.com\u002Fostermanj\u002F1fca89adfbd045bb9a9e948b3b157293\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nPretty great! Now displaying or hiding the description depends on the size of the container rather than the viewport. That means the component can be used elsewhere without having to redefine at what screen sizes the description should appear. Code it once and use it everywhere.\n\n## Use them now?\n\nI'll be using container queries from here on out in personal projects soon, I hope, in work projects for production.\n\nContainer queries are landing in browsers and, at the time I'm writing this, have about 75% browser support globally. Firefox, notably, does not yet support them in the stable release but does in the nightly release. Coverage should be good enough now or very soon to use them in a progressive-enhancement sort of way, when you can accept that some browsers won't abide.\n\nThere is a [JavaScript polyfill](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FGoogleChromeLabs\u002Fcontainer-query-polyfill) available that simply works.

Corps in a time of war",subtitle:"The US bombs Iraq and things get weird",datePublished:"2023-04-06",body:"In early 2003, the drumbeat of a war was reaching a fever pitch and things in Mauritania were getting tense. We'd been preparing mentally to be evacuated ever since September 11. In the weeks just after the attacks, when we were all huddled together at the \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Emaison\u003C\u002Fi\u003E in Nouakchott, a fellow volunteer known for histrionics (you know who you are! lol) burst into a room where we were playing mafia or some such thing and said, \"I just heard from the bureau! The US has bombed Damascus and we've been ordered to evacuate. Time to pack your bags!\"\n\nWe all believed him. That was exactly how it was going to happen.\n\nEighteen months later, it did happen, only it wasn't Damascus getting bombed but Baghdad. In the end we weren't evacuated, but I believe we came close. Things certainly got a little wild.\n\nWe all thought we'd be sent home once the war started, and we'd been waiting for it for a long time. The BBC World Service reported each fractional step closer to war for months. That was my early-21st-century version of doom scrolling: breaking out my shortwave radio every hour on the hour to take part in the slow build toward catastrophe. While we expected protests borne of Arab solidarity and latent anti-Americanism, the only aggression I witnessed was an old lady cursing me and spitting at my feet. Was that because of Iraq? Hard to know.\n\nNonetheless, on March 18 armed local police started guarding our homes in Aioun. The next day, when the bombing began, the police started following us around town, which made visiting people or going to the market a little awkward. It didn't last long. The head of police for the region or town decided to consolidate all the foreigners together. The Germans all went to a German expat's place; the French and Americans all went to a French expat's. Believe me, there were worse places to be. We already knew his place very well. We'd gather there for dinner parties, to swim in his pool, to drink and smoke cigarettes, and to watch TV. It was a decadent, epicurean oasis.\n\nWe were in our decadent house arrest for nearly a week when things got weird and uncanny. At first, it was just us four Peace Corps volunteers and one of the French volunteers, enjoying the hospitality of our gracious host. Then another French volunteer showed up. Then a French guy on a motorcycle showed up. Then two Swedish tourists showed up. Basically, any non-German foreigner passing through Aioun‚Äîusually a rare event!‚Äîwas put under house arrest with us. We nine uninvited houseguests lived together for a few days, vying for sleeping space, sharing wine, hoping to wait out the threat so that we could go our various ways.\n\nOur momentary life of luxury wasn't exactly without care. In general, I was ready to go. I'd basically completed my service. But specifically, there were a lot of things I hadn't done. I didn't have many souvenirs; I had no pictures of my students; I had had no closure with anyone I would have wanted closure with. Despite the pool and the booze and other comforts of my enclosure, it was stressful to see my service potentially end with such a whimper. Plus one of the French guys came down with malaria, left to go to the hospital, and came back later, IV bag in tow, to sleep off his fever for a few days. Fun times.\n\nAfter four days the Wali decided that the Americans should go to Nouakchott. He called the bureau to ask them to get us out of Aioun, and they agreed to either charter a plane or have us get on the next commercial flight to the capital. For some reason the plane never showed up, and it was a few days later before a Peace Corp vehicle arrived with its logos long ago removed. We were to leave town at 4:30 the next morning to avoid trouble.\n\nMy memory of what happened next is dim. My journal skips 10 days. My next entry is a largely illegible poem about doubt, confusion, and frustration rising from a romantic pursuit, which means that we volunteers were together again in Nouakchott. A few days later the option was out: for the second time during my service (the first was after September 11) any volunteer who wanted to leave Mauritania (early terminate) could do so without repercussion and perhaps continue their service elsewhere. At that point I only had less than two months to go, so I stayed.\n\nI returned to Aioun around April 22. Protests and threats in response to the invasion of Iraq never amounted to much. It was good to be back, to get back to my routine and to teaching, and to trying to do Peace Corps in a time of war. I don't know what my students did while I was gone, whether a fellow teacher covered for me or if the kids just had some extra free time, but there was some extra writing on the wall, caricatures of George Bush and graffiti calling him a dog. I didn't disagree but I pretended not to notice.\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Bush dog](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F1MT1PlfQq4QkmHku0lDud8\u002Fa9357c86a01a4dce233d6453ea3cb58a\u002Fbush-dog_r.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EI returned to Aioun to some new graffiti in the classroom.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\n\n![Bush dog](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F6wGHos2mAVj6mDUSACruZC\u002F95c4be2425a5920a2917910cf95c89d2\u002Fbush-dog2_r.jpg)\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption\u003EBush is \u003Ci lang=\"fr\"\u003Eterroriste\u003C\u002Fi\u003E.\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\nThe next weeks‚Äîmy last weeks‚Äîwent quickly. I witnessed no further aggression or protests. My students were nice and thankful that I tried to teach some of them English. They, like most people, could like a person and disdain their government without suffering cognitive dissonance. Perhaps my presence tempered some ill will toward my country. Perhaps it heightened it. I don't know.\n\nEither way, on May 31, 2003, my mission really was accomplished.\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\nMay 31, 2003\n\nI just woke up: my last full day in Aioun. It rained last night, the first thing past a drizzle for the season. I woke from the wind and saw nothing in the sky. An ominous dark shielding the usual night glow. The possibility of rain didn't cross my mind; I fell back asleep to awake sometime later to the drops on my forehead. Rain.\n\nAnd it smelled like rain, too, like earth, like wet cereal.\n\nThe rain grew steady and the wind was blowing into the porch. I had to move all the way inside where it was too warm to properly sleep. I drifted in and out with new visions each time I closed my eyes. Flashlights in the yard, a woman in bed, my homecoming back in the States.\n\nI awaken to quiet. The rain has slowed. I move back out to the porch where the breeze is pleasant and cool. It's dark, nearly completely so, and I go to fill my buckets for bath and drinking water. It must be near 4 a.m. The water comes pretty strongly.\n\nReplete, I stumble back to my matela and collapse. Soon the sun comes. Then the flies, then the goats, and I have no choice but to begin my last day in Aioun.\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\n![Mission accomplished](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002F3qr5d6sj491p\u002F4LKNIB7XyC4933wqoGS57J\u002F17c242bdfae3b53e512b49df3e296dd5\u002Fclassroom_mission-accomplished.jpg)",snippet:"In early 2003, the drumbeat of a war was reaching a fever pitch and things in Mauritania were getting tense.
